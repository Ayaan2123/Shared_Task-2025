Eruption of wisdom tooth may at the most suggest that the age of the person is 17 years or above but non-eruption or absence of wisdom tooth does not conclusively prove that the person is below 18 years of age. Therefore, the mere fact that wisdom tooth have not erupted is not of great importance in assessing the age,\" the judge held. \nThe bench was hearing an appeal filed by one Maherban Hasan Babu Khan challenging his conviction under charges of rape and other relevant provisions of the POCSO Act. \nAs per the prosecution case, he had sexual intercourse with the victim girl on the promise of marriage. However, when she informed him that she was pregnant on March 25, 2016, he said he will return to Raigad from his native place in Uttar Pradesh and marry her. But he did not marry her and in fact avoided her.\nTherefore, the victim, who claimed that she was born on December 19, 2000, lodged a criminal complaint against him, after which he was arrested. \nIn his defence, the man claimed that he wanted to marry the victim and after his return from Uttar Pradesh, he tried to trace her but she was not traceable and suddenly he was arrested by the Police. He maintained that he would want to marry the girl and even look after the child she gave birth to. \nIn the judgment, Justice Prabhudesai noted that the prosecution did not examine relevant witnesses to prove the victim's age and thus it remained unproved.\n\"The prosecution has also not adduced any evidence regarding the victim’s physical growth and development and secondary sexual character. This discrepancy also leaves room for ample doubt with regard to the correct age of the victim, the benefit of which must necessarily go in favour of the appellant,\" the judge observed.\nThe prosecution, therefore, failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the victim was below 18 years of age, the Court held. \n\"This was relevant as the evidence on record otherwise indicates that the physical relationship between the Appellant and the victim was consensual. In the absence of evidence to prove that the victim was below 18 years of age, the provisions of the POCSO Act cannot be invoked and consensual relationship would not constitute rape within the meaning of Section 375 of the IPC,\" the bench underscored.\nIt, therefore, quashed the conviction and acquitted the appellant.\nAdvocates Jagdish Kumar and Sanjeev Hegde appeared for the Appellant.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor NB Patil represented the State. \nAdvocate Rebecca Gonsalves represented the victim."}

If the Government can provide maternity leave to an adoptive mother, it would be wholly improper to refuse to provide maternity leave to a mother who begets a child through the surrogacy procedure and as such, there cannot be any distinction between an adoptive mother who adopts a child and a mother who begets a child through surrogacy procedure after implanting an embryo created by using either the eggs or sperm of the intended parents in the womb of the surrogate mother,\" the Court held.\nIt said that no distinction can be made by the State between a natural mother, a biological mother and a mother who has begotten a child through surrogacy. \n\"Because the right to life contained under Article 21 includes the right of motherhood and the right of the child to get love, bond of affection and full care and attention. Therefore, the action of the State is quite unjustified in denying maternity leave to the surrogate mother (the petitioner) for taking care of her twins born through surrogacy method. Making a difference between natural biological mother and surrogate/commissioning mother would amount to insult of motherhood,\" the Court opined.\nIt further clarified that babies born through surrogacy cannot be left at the mercy of others since they infants need the love, care, protection and attention of mother during their infancy since the bond of love and affection develops between the mother and children during this period after birth.\n\"Motherhood is the mother of all civilizations. Family as a social institution is considered as the backbone of the society. No civilization could have passed without recognizing the power of mother and often figuratively projected her as Goddess. A child born to a family sees the world first through the eyes of his/her mother and develops his/her skills through the vision of the family,\" the Court said. \nThe order was passed on a plea filed by a woman who begot twins through the process of surrogacy. \nAfter the birth of the twins, the petitioner sought to avail the Maternity leaves as per the Rajasthan Service Rules, 1958.\nHowever, she was denied maternity leaves on the ground that there is no provision under the 1958 Rules to grant maternity leave to couple having children through surrogacy.\nWhile ordering the State authorities to grant the petitioner her 180 days maternity leaves, the bench noted that though courts across the country have held that there can be no discrimination in granting such leaves to biological or surrogate mothers. \n\"Once, it has been held by the several High Courts of our Nation including this Court that there is no distinction between the natural, biological and surrogate or commissioning mothers and all of them have fundamental right to life and motherhood, contained under Article 21 and children born from the process of surrogacy have the right to life, care, protection, love, affection and development through their mother, then certainly such mothers have right to get maternity leave,\" the Court underscored.\nThe Court, however, noted that the law was silent in this regard and hence urged the government to bring appropriate legislation. \n\"Hence, this is high time for the government to bring appropriate legislation in this regard for grant of maternity leave to the surrogate and commissioning mothers,\" the judge recommended.\nIt ordered the High Court Registry to forward the copy of the order to the Union Ministry of Law and Justice as well as to the Principal Secretary, Department of Law and Legal Affairs, Government of Rajasthan for action.\nAdvocates Rajesh Kapoor and Harshad Kapoor appeared for the Petitioner.\nAdditional Advocate General Dr V B Sharma represented the State."}

The Supreme Court is simply accepting a social reality and it has no intention to unravel the fabric of Indian family life,\" the High Court's order stated. \nThe bench proceeded to opine that the writ jurisdiction of High Courts, being an extraordinary jurisdiction, is not meant to resolve disputes between private parties. \n\"We believe that it is a social problem which can be uprooted socially and not by the intervention of the Writ Court in the garb of violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India unless harassment is established beyond doubt,\" the Court said.\nThe Court added that the petitioners before the Court can file a first information report (FIR) in the matter, if they are facing any threat to their lives on account of harassment from their relatives.\nThe Court added that if the parents or relatives find that their son or daughter has eloped for the purpose of marriage while underage or against their will, they are equally at liberty to take similar steps.\nThe Court was dealing with a plea for protection filed by a 29-year-old Hindu woman and a 30-year-old Muslim man. \nThe couple had claimed that they were being harassed by the police. The Court was also told that the woman's mother disapproved of the live-in relationship and that an FIR was filed against them.\nThe couple argued that no individual should interfere in their personal life and yet they were experiencing harassment from the police. \nHence, they requested protection from the Court, while citing the precedent set by the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Lata Singh v State of UP (2006).\nThe Court, however, declined to intervene in the matter. It noted that the petitioners had not claimed that they were legally married, nor had they sought to protect a marital relationship. Rather, the petitioners had only argued that, as adults, they had the right to live with whomever they choose, the Court observed.\nThe Court found that, instead of filing a criminal complaint against the alleged harassment, \"only a fictitious application with certain allegations, particularly by such persons as the petitioners herein enjoying a live-in relationship, is moved under Writ jurisdiction of the High Court.\"\nThe Court added that the case appeared to be \"a circuitous way to get the seal and signature of the High Court upon their conduct without any verification of their age and other necessary aspects required to be done by the appropriate authority.\"\nThe Court also noted that Muslim law did not permit sexual relations outside marriage, including premarital relations and extra-marital relations. \n\"In fact any sexual, lustful, affectionate acts such as kissing, touching, staring etc. are 'Haram' in Islam before marriage because these are considered parts of 'Zina' which may lead to actual 'Zina' itself. The punishment for such offence according to Quran (chapter 24) is hundred lashes for the unmarried male and female who commit fornication together with the punishment prescribed by the \"Sunnah\" for the married male and female that is stoning to death,\" the Court observed. \nThe bench further opined that there is a need to create awareness in young minds about the emotional and societal pressures and legal hassles which may ensue live-in relations.\n\"Awareness has to be created in young minds not just from the point of view of emotional and societal pressures that such relationships may create, but also from the perspective that it could give rise to various legal hassles on issues like division of property, violence and cheating within live-in relationships, rehabilitation in case of desertion by or death of a partner and handling of custody and other issues when it comes to children born from such relationships.

Rajiv Luthra).\nThe verdict was pronounced by a Single Judge Bench of Justice V Kameswar Rao after it was reserved on December 9, 2020.\nThe judgment reads,\n\"In view of my above discussion, prima facie the termination of the petitioner from partnership by the respondent in terms of email dated October 13, 2020 being in violation of the Deed and the Partnership Act, keeping in view the mandate of Section 12 of the Partnership Act, where a partner has the right to take part in the conduct of the business and also keeping away the petitioner from the partnership business shall be to his prejudice, if he finally succeeds in the prospective arbitration proceedings, I direct that there shall be a stay of the operation of the email dated October 13, 2020 issued by the respondent terminating the petitioner from the partnership till the conclusion of the prospective arbitration proceedings.\"\nOn the issue of the status of Saraf and Luthra as partners of the firm, the Court held,\n\"I agree with the submission of learned Counsels for the petitioner that partners in the firm stand on equal footing. One partner acts as an agent of the other(s). Together they constitute a firm. The partnership per se is not a distinct legal entity.\"\nOn the question of Saraf's termination from the partnership, the Court delved into clauses of the partnership deed, concluding,\n\"When the later part of Clause 7A contemplates approval of respondent/RKL and petitioner/MS in the decision-making process, then earlier part of Clause 7A cannot be construed to mean the power of the respondent/RKL to terminate petitioner/MS. I also note, as per Clause 10B, power vests with both the petitioner and the respondent to take decision with regard amalgamation, merger, collaboration and buy-out of the firm by third parties. This clause appears to be at variance with the initial limb of Clause 7A.\nBe that as it may, when a vital decision with regard to buy-out of firm requires the concurrence of both the petitioner and the respondent, it cannot be construed that \"termination\" under Clause 7A would mean the grant of power on respondent to terminate the petitioner from partnership which has come into existence on the execution of the Deed by both the petitioner and the respondent.\"\nJustice Rao thus took the prima facie view that the only purpose for the word \"termination\" in clause 7A of the deed was for termination of equity partners who would be inducted by Rajiv Luthra from his equity share, and does not contemplate termination of Saraf from the firm.\nThe Court also agreed with Saraf's contention that his termination from the partnership of the firm was not in good faith, for the following reasons:\n(i) The termination was effected by invoking provisions which do not contemplate termination of the petitioner as a partner; \n(ii) The termination was effected immediately after the issuance of email dated October 12, 2020 by the petitioner acknowledging the decision of respondent to withdraw / retire from the firm; \n(iii) No challenge is made by the respondent to the email dated October 12, 2020; \n(iv) In the absence of a challenge to email dated October 12, 2020, the respondent prima facie could not have issued the email dated October 13, 2020; and \n(v) The respondent resorted to the termination of the petitioner from partnership and not dissolution/termination of Deed as contemplated under the notice/communication dated January 06, 2020.\nThe Court further noted,\n\"The plea of the Counsels for the respondent that even if there is no explicit power, there is an implied power to terminate the partnership of the petitioner is also not appealing. Firstly, the statute i.e., the Partnership Act do not contemplate termination of a partner. Such a provision can neither expressly nor impliedly be read in the statute nor in the Deed. What is contemplated under the Partnership Act is expulsion of a partner under Section 33, but in good faith of powers stipulated in the partnership deed. No such power of expulsion is also stipulated.\"\nOn the induction of 23 new equity partners by Saraf and 2 by Luthra, the Court noted,\n\"I have serious doubt on the stand of the parties, for the reason that the induction of partners could have only taken place with the approval of the other partner. It is the case of the parties here, no approval was taken by the opposite party for the induction of respective partners by them. In the absence of any approval, no induction of partner could have been made. \nSo, it follows on acceptance of withdrawal/retirement of the respondent by the petitioner in terms of email dated October 12, 2020 or termination of partnership of the petitioner vide email dated October 13, 2020 by the respondent, the partnership stood dissolved.\"\nPrima facie, it was held that the termination of Saraf from the partnership being illegal and in violation of the deed, and in the absence of Luthra's power to take such an action, Saraf must be reinstated.\nSaraf had moved the High Court in October last year after he was removed from the L&L partnership by Luthra.\nIn his petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, Saraf pressed for the restoration of \"last uncontested status\" at L&L Partners while his dispute with Luthra is referred to arbitration.\nWhereas the High Court had initially suggested that the parties refer their dispute to mediation, the matter found its way back in Court after talks failed to make any headway.\nAsserting that there was no master-servant relationship between them, Saraf argued before the High Court that his ouster from the law firm was illegal and unless the L&L partnership was dissolved, he would continue to be a partner.\nDefending his letter accepting Luthra's retirement, Saraf said that Luthra's intention to leave the firm and take the \"golden handshake\" was visible from the series of letters written by him.\nIt was also claimed that there was a complete breach of bona fides on the part of Luthra and that the two mandatory 90-day notices required for his termination from the firm as per the deed were not served on him.\nRajiv Luthra, on the other hand, argued that the L&L partnership was an \"an unequal marriage\" in which he retained certain special rights including the right to oust Saraf from the firm.\nWhile clarifying that he never intended to leave the law firm that he built, Luthra accused Saraf of conduct \"unbecoming of a lawyer\", for leaking confidential information of the firm and sharing private WhatsApp communication with third parties.\nHe thus opposed grant of any relief in the petition on account of the admitted position of both parties that they cannot work together anyone. It was also argued that the relief of reinstatement was barred under the Specific Relief Act.\nSenior Advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, and Amarjit Singh Chandhiok had appeared for Rajiv Luthra.\nSenior Advocates Parag Tripathi and Arvind Nigam assisted by advocate Sandeep Das argued for Mohit Saraf.\nThe relationship between the two senior-most partners at L&L Partners turned sour after they reached an impasse over the dilution of the firm's equity.\nOn September 24, a firm-wide Zoom conference turned a bit ugly, with Luthra and Saraf both making allegations against each other. Luthra openly spoke against Saraf and his future plans with regard to the firm, while Saraf retaliated and made some nasty remarks against Luthra.\nEven as Saraf rejected Luthra's proposal that all partners holding equity dilute their stake in the firm, the latter went on to induct two equity partners into the firm.\nEventually, Saraf wrote to the corporate partners stating that he had accepted Luthra's earlier offer to retire and withdraw from the firm. He also alleged that there were \"material breaches of the partnership deed\" by Luthra.\nIn response, Luthra not only denied retiring from the law firm, but also terminated Saraf's partnership on account of the latter's \"clumsy strategy\" on equity dilution.\nLuthra pointed out the lack of legal sanctity of the content of Saraf's email, as per which the founder of the firm was put on \"imaginary retirement/withdrawal\" from the firm."}

The maxim “Action personalis moritur cum persona” (A personal action dies with the person) is applicable, so far as future maintenance is concerned. So far as the arrears of maintenance is concerned, it is a property of wife as per the explanation 2 Section 14 of Hindu Succession Act,\" the High Court said. \nThe Court agreed with the respondent counsel's submission that since a mother was entitled to the property of her daughter, in the present case, the respondent mother was entitled to the arrears of maintenance accrued till the death of her daughter. \n\"In view of Section 15(1)(c) of the Hindu Succession Act, the mother is entitled to the property of her daughter.

We have made it clear that such extension during superannuation should be done in rarest of rare cases,\" Justice Rao said reading out the verdict. \nThe top court held that in Section 25(d) of CVC Act, the words ‘not less than two years’ cannot be read to mean ‘not more than two years’ and that \" there is no fetter on the power of the Central Government in appointing the Director of Enforcement beyond a period of two years.\"\n\"It is clear that the minimum period of two years provided in Section 25 (d) is to prevent extraneous pressure. Prescription of a minimum period of two years is to ensure that the Director of Enforcement is not transferred or shifted from the said post during the course of investigation of serious offences. There is no ambiguity in Section 25 (d) of CVC Act and the words ‘not less than two years’ simply mean a minimum of two years. There is no scope for reading the words to mean not more than two years. Reading such a restriction would be contrary to the recommendations of the Independent Review Committee and the judgment of this Court in Vineet Narain,\" held the Supreme Court.\nThe judgment was delivered on a plea by NGO Common Cause seeking to quash the November 13, 2020, order of the ED amending the tenure of Mishra which the NGO claimed was in violation of Section 25 of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003.\nThe top court further held that the curtailment of the tenure of a Director Enforcement would be detrimental to the interests of officers who are appointed to the post and have service of more than two years before they attain the age of superannuation.\n\"We hold that a Director of Enforcement can be appointed for a period of more than two years by following the procedure prescribed under Section 25 of the CVC Act,\" reads the judgment.\nSection 25(c) of the Act provides that no person below the rank of Additional Secretary to the Government of India shall be eligible for appointment as a Director of Enforcement and Section 25(d) of the Act provides that a Director of Enforcement shall continue to hold office for a period of not less than two years from the date on which he assumes office.\nMishra, vide order dated November, 2018, was appointed as Director of Enforcement in the ED for a period of two years from the date of assumption of charge of the post or until further orders, whichever fell earlier.\nThe said two-year tenure ended in November last year.\nMishra had already reached the retirement age of 60 years in May, 2020.\nHowever, the Central government on November 13, 2020 issued an office order in which it was stated that the President has modified the 2018 order to the effect that a period of ‘two years’ written in the 2018 order was modified to a period of ‘three years’.\nThe plea said that the purpose behind Section 25 (d) of the Act, in providing a minimum tenure of two years, is only to insulate the Director of Enforcement from all kinds of influences and pressures.\n\"However, the said purpose gets defeated if on the verge of his two-year tenure and much after his retirement age, the Director of Enforcement is given a de facto extension in service by adoption of a circuitous route of modifying the initial appointment order itself,\" the petition said.\nSuch illegalities in appointment of the Director of Enforcement will shake the confidence of citizens in the institution of Enforcement Directorate, it was contended."}

The only effective way to curb such cruelty is by blacklisting those handlers or owners found subjecting their equines to cruelty and maltreatment, it added.\n\"It is only the fear of being debarred from carrying on their business, that will drive the erring handlers/ owners of equines, to fall in line,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also directed the District Magistrate of Rudraprayag and other authorities to ensure such equines are not deployed between sunset and sunrise, so they may have sufficient rest breaks. \nThis direction is applicable to the use of equines in the Kedarnath, Yamunotri, and Hemkund Sahib yatras.\nAn order restricting the use of such animals between sunset and sunrise has already been issued, the District Magistrate told the High Court.

Framing the argument on the legitimacy of the decisions of this Court purely in terms of electoral democracy ignores the Constitution itself and the values it seeks to engender,\" his judgment said.\nThe Constitution does not envisage such a procedural form of democracy, he added in his minority opinion.\nThe CJI proceeded to reject the proposition by the Central government that an exercise of powers of judicial review by the apex court would constrain the right of citizens to participate in political processes.\n\"The Constitution does not confine the universe of a constitutional democracy to an electoral democracy.

Additionally, it overlooks the importance of a Constitution which prescribes underlying values and rules of governance for the sustenance of a democratic regime,\" he opined.\nTo elaborate, the CJI pointed out that it was through court intervention that the right to education was deemed a fundamental right. \nHowever, he opined that such intervention is not possible in the same-sex marriage case as the Constitution does not recognise a right to marriage. \n\"The right to education was held to be a fundamental right, not because of any statute or law but because of its centrality to the values that the Constitution espouses. The arguments of the petitioners that the Constitution recognises a right to marry is hinged on the meaning accorded to marriage by statutes, which cannot be accepted,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, the Indian Supreme Court ruled against giving legal recognition to same-sex marriages or marriages involving queer couples, or even conferring such unions the status of a civil partnership.\nAll five judges on a Constitution bench including the CJI unanimously opined that it was up to the legislature to take a call on giving legal recognition to marriages between same-sex partners.\nThe Court further unanimously turned down a challenge to provisions of the Special Marriage Act to the extent it exclude queer couples.\nHowever, CJI Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul opined that relationships between queer persons should be recognised as civil partnerships. \nThe two judges further opined that the current laws excluding unmarried couples including queer couples from adopting children are liable to be set aside.\nHowever, the other three judges, who were in majority, disagreed on these aspects too. \nNotably, CJI Chandrachud in his minority judgment also rejected arguments that unions between LGBTQ+ individuals were not \"Indian.\"\nAll sexual and gender minorities are just as Indian as fellow citizens who are heterosexual or cisgender, he said.\n\"A thing, an occurrence, or a practice is ‘Indian’ when it is present in India, takes place here, or is practised by Indian citizens. Something which is Indian could be present from time immemorial or it could be a recent development. Regardless, this is not a game of numbers.

[Nitin Kumar Tomar vs The State Govt of NCT of Delhi]\nJustice Swarana Kanta Sharma highlighted the troubling reality of marriages being distorted into a vessel for unchecked dominance and entitlement.\n\"Embedded within this warped perception is a dangerous belief that the marital bond grants unchecked authority to the husband, transforming his wife into a mere object to be wielded at will. The portrayal of the victim as a commodity reflects a deeply entrenched societal mindset that views women as objects to be controlled, exploited, and disposed of at will,\" the Court said.\nThe Court was hearing an application by a man seeking anticipatory bail in connection with a first information report (FIR) registered against him under Sections 498A (cruelty by husband or his relative), 406 (Criminal breach of trust), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe complaint registered by the man's wife alleged severe physical, emotional and sexual abuse. She detailed instances of coercion, violence, and exploitation by her husband including demands for dowry, forced sexual acts and threats of public shaming.\nThe counsel for the accused argued that the complainant had stayed in her matrimonial home for a very short duration with the accused and was falsely implicating him in the case. He also argued that it was the complainant who did not wish to reside with the accused and was therefore, concocting a false story.\nFurther, he argued that the complainant had filed several cases against the accused only to harass him and that he had never demanded any money from the complainant or her parents. Accordingly, he sought anticipatory bail.\nAssistant Public Prosecutor (APP) Satish Kumar, on the other hand, argued that the allegations against the applicant were serious. \nHe underlined that there were specific allegations that the complainant was tortured by the accused and his family for not meeting dowry demands. He further highlighted that the accused used to beat the complainant, had burnt her hands and had made objectionable videos of her. Accordingly, he sought dismissal of the bail application. \nThe Court observed that in the case of Sumitha Pradeep v Arun Kumar CK, the Supreme Court had elucidated the factors to be considered when deciding the grant of anticipatory bail - the existence of a prima facie case against the accused, the nature of the offence and the severity of the potential punishment.\nThe apex court had also held that even if custodial interrogation is not required or necessitated, the same by itself cannot be a ground to grant anticipatory bail.\nThe Court stated that in most cases, a woman's unemployment becomes her handicap in raising her voice against atrocities for the fear of being ousted from her matrimonial home.\nHowever, it noted that in many cases before it, the fact that a woman is earning and employed becomes her handicap too on the premise that she is independent and not inclined towards living with her husband.\n\"There is no dearth of cases placed before this Court highlighting another disturbing trend where the factum of a woman earning and employed becomes her handicap too, on the premise that since being a woman, she is earning and independent, she is not herself inclined to live with the husband and the in-laws, conveniently trying to put under wraps the reason for her to raise her voice against physical, mental, sexual and economic abuse by the husband,\" the Court said.\nReferring to the complainant's detailed account and supporting medical records, the Court noted a pattern of abuse and exploitation.\n\"A perusal of record clearly reveals a pattern of abuse and exploitation perpetrated by the applicant against his wife, demonstrating a blatant disregard for her well-being and autonomy. It is shocking that as a married earning woman, even to pay fee to the doctor and to buy medicines, she had to ask the accused/husband who told her that her father had not given enough money to take her to a doctor or to buy medicines for her,\" the Court noted.\nSince the allegations were specifically narrated with time, place and the manner of incidents, the Court determined that the argument of the applicant that he was falsely implicated was of no material consequence at the stage.\nAccordingly, the Court took the opinion that the accused should be dealt with with a stern hand. \nIt further underlined that his custodial interrogation may be required for the purpose of recovering any inappropriate photographs, conversations, audios or videos as alleged by the complainant.

She falsely stated that the incident took place around three years ago, he added.\nFurther, it was argued that the parents of the prosecutrix and the applicant opposed their marriage as they are from different religions - the applicant is a Hindu whereas the prosecutrix is a Muslim. Hence, it cannot be said that the applicant has committed rape on the prosecutrix on the pretext of marriage.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the State submitted that no case for grant of bail is made out as the applicant had repeatedly committed rape on the prosecutrix on the pretext of marriage since October 2018.\nFurther, it was highlighted that he refused to marry her and informed her on June 1 that his marriage was fixed to some other person. Following this, the prosecutrix attempted to commit suicide by consuming phenyl, but ultimately survived.\nThe Court took note of the fact that the prosecutrix had tried to commit suicide, which apparently shows that she was serious about the relationship, and that it cannot be said that she entered into the relationship only for enjoyment.\nHence, after considering the material placed on record and the submissions, the Court rejected the bail plea of the applicant/accused.\n\"On due consideration of the rival submissions and on perusal of the case diary, this Court does not find it to be a fit case for grant of bail as apparently the applicant has allured the prosecutrix to enter into a physical relationship on the pretext of marriage despite knowing fully well that both of them are from different religion.\""}

MR Vijayabhaskar & Ors).\nThe order was passed by a Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah in a plea calling into question the oral observations made by the Madras High Court to the effect that the poll body was singularly responsible for the COVID-19 situation in India and that it should probably be put on murder charges for failing to ensure compliance of COVID-19 protocol during election rallies.\nPronouncing its verdict today, the Bench held,\n\"In a constitutional framework based on checks and balances can ECI set up a plea when there is constitutional immunity to a body? We say courts must be open save and except for in camera proceedings like marital privacy etc.\"\nOn the freedom of the media to report court proceedings, the Court held,\n\"...open access to court is the cornerstone of constitutional freedom. Article 19(1)(a) covers freedom of press. Freedom of speech and expression covers freedom to cover court proceedings too...\"\nReferring to the reporting of court proceedings in real-time by the digital media, the Court said,\n\"Now people are more digital oriented and hence look to internet for information. hence it would do no good to prevent a new medium to report proceedings. constitutional bodies will do better than complain about this...\n...With the advent of technology we are seeing reporting with real time updates its a part of freedom of speech and expression of press. Its an extension of open court.\"\nRegarding the specific remarks made by the Madras High Court, the Bench noted,\n\"...we understand that the High Court was facing rising cases of COVID-19. The remarks were harsh and the metaphor improper. High Court did not attribute culpability to the ECI for the spread of COVID-19...\"\nJustice Chandrachud thus called for judicial restraint when it comes to making \"off-the-cuff remarks\", which can be open for misinterpretation.\n\"A degree of caution and restraint on part of the High Court would have allayed these proceedings. Oral remarks are not part of the order and hence there is no question of expungement,\" the order said.\nThe Court thus found no substance in the prayer of ECI to restrain the media from reporting court proceedings. \n\"It is essential to hold the judiciary accountable,\" the Court recorded.\nThe High Court had made the remark while hearing a petition by AIADMK's R Vijayabhaskar raising concerns over whether adequate facilities are in place to ensure COVID-19 protocol during vote counting at the Karur constituency. During the April 26 hearing, Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee had remarked,\n“You are the only institution that is responsible for the situation today. No action against political parties taking rallies despite every order of the Court. Your Election Commission should be put up on murder charges probably!”\nThe ECI had first approached the High Court taking objection to the said remark. In its plea before Madras High Court, the poll body had sought directions to be issued to media houses to confine their reports to observations recorded in orders or judgments and to refrain from reporting on oral observations made during court proceedings in the case. \nHowever, the High Court declined to entertain the plea, prompting the appeal before the Supreme Court.\nWhen the appeal was heard on May 3, the Supreme Court had made it clear that it cannot interfere with the oral observations made by High Courts, saying that such dialogue between Bar and Bench while hearing cases is an essential facet of the judicial process.\n\"The discussions that take place are of importance and are in public interest. It’s not a monologue that one person will speak and then judges will speak,\" said Justice Chandrachud.\nSuch dialogues and reporting of such dialogues by media create accountability, the top court had said while underscoring that anything to the contrary could be seen as affecting independence of High Courts.\n\"We have to protect the judicial sanctity of the process. We have to make sure that High Court judges and Chief Justices are independent to make views. We have to make sure that media reports everything that happens in court so that we judges conduct proceedings with dignity,\" the Court said.\nAny order passed in favour of the ECI could affect the morale of High Courts, the apex court added.\n\"We are looking at this from a long term and impact on functioning of High Courts. We don't want to demoralise our High Courts. They are vital pillars of our democracy. Things are often said in an open dialogue between bar and bench,\" the Court had opined. \nThe plea by ECI stated that the Madras High Court, being an independent constitutional authority, made serious allegations of murder on another independent constitutional authority without any basis, which has ultimately dented both the institutions.\nThe High Court being a Constitutional court of first record ought not have made the said oral observation levelling such serious allegation against ECI without any proof, it was submitted. The remarks were uncalled for, blatantly disparaging and derogatory, it was contended. \n#SupremeCourt bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud to shortly deliver JUDGMENT on an appeal filed by ECI against the oral observations made by Madras HC that @ECISVEEP was \"singularly responsible\" for the #COVIDSecondWave in India & should be tried for \"murder charges\"#MadrasHC pic.twitter.com/szkvECBUhH"}

However, it is the choice of the complainant, who may decide as to whether the person who retweeted such content had caused him more damage or not, since he had more friends or followers, by sharing a content; \nWhen a political person of some standing or a public figure or a social influencer posts some content on his/her social media account, it can be reasonably believed at the initial stage of a case where summoning is in question, that he did understand the repercussions and implications of posting such content and the corresponding harm it can cause to the person aggrieved;\nLarge social media following of a Chief Minister of a State implies a wider reach, making any retweet a form of public endorsement or acknowledgment;\nIf the act of retweeting or reposting is allowed to be misused, it will encourage people to repost defamatory content. A sense of responsibility has to be attached the act of retweeting.\nKerjriwal was sued for defamation for re-tweeting a video titled ‘BJP IT Cell Part 2’ made by YouTuber Dhruv Rathee. \nThe Court upheld the trial court order summoning him in the case and concluded that there was no infirmity in the order. \nSenior Advocate Manish Vashishth along with advocates Karan Sharma, Rishabh Sharma, Vedanth Vashishth, Mohd Irshad and Harshita Nathrani appeared for Arvind Kejriwal.\nVikas Pandey was represented by advocates Raghav Awasthi, Kunal Tiwari and Mukesh Sharma.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Manoj Pant appeared for the State."}

Together they can deal with any situation, balancing the family in all circumstances. If one pillar gets weak or breaks, the whole house crashes down. The pillars can withstand all the abuses together, the moment one pillar gets weak or deteriorates, it becomes difficult to hold the house together. When one pillar gives up, and puts all the burden on the other pillar, then it cannot be expected that one pillar will single handedly hold the house together,\" the Bench observed.\nBefore the High Court, the husband had challenged an August 2021 family court order decreeing a divorce in favour of the wife on the ground of cruelty under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nThe couple had gotten married in 1997, and later had two daughters. Subsequently, the relationship turned sour and the couple opted for divorce before a Saket Court, which, while decreeing divorce in the wife's favour, struck off the husband's defence.\nIn his plea, the husband claimed that he took proper care of his daughters and his wife, and was a doting father. He claimed to have helped his in-laws clear their debt, despite which the wife often quarrelled with him and even doubted his character. He claimed that the wife physically and mentally harassed and tortured him.\nThe wife alleged that her husband has not been paying for the expenses of the family and instead she had to single-handedly look after her daughters while working. She highlighted the fact that her husband had been defying court orders asking him to pay maintenance.\nThe husband had made a specific contention that his wife subjected him to cruelty by making claims that he was an impotent and was weak in sex. However, the Bench noted from the family court orders that the husband himself had told the wife that he had become weak in sex and thus, the couple could not consummate the marriage.\nThe Bench noted that the family court did not premise its orders on this contention, and in fact, did not mention impotency or anything of that sort in its orders.\nAfter examining the material on record, the Bench concluded that it did not find any reason to differ with the view expressed by the family court.\n\"The husband had put the entire burden on the wife to manage the house, her job, and to look after the children. He did not take any responsibility and, on the other hand, continuously abused her and insulted her family members. He even disrespected her father, and doubted her character. He demanded money to give divorce to her and failed to discharge his duties as a husband – and especially as a father. Even after directions of this Court and the Family Court, he falsified about his earnings and failed to pay the maintenance for his daughters.

In the absence of the same, if this act of derogating other’s religious sentiments is permitted to continue, it would rather act as a parasite, which would eat the society itself and create an uncalled for animosity resulting into public disorder and unrest,\" the judge observed in the April 17 order.  \n\"Deliberate means, it is a conscious act, made by a person belonging to a particular community to outrage the respect, which other religion equally enjoys in this country,\" the judge said.  \nThe bench was hearing with a plea filed by one Brajesh, the deputy district secretary of Rashtriya Hindu Vahini, Udham Singh Nagar, who had posted a derogatory post against Muslim community on his WhatsApp Status, on October 22, 2019.  \nA complaint was lodged against him alleging that the derogatory remarks and post made by the accused, outraged the religious sentiments of the minority community.\nIn the instant petition, the accused pointed out that there was an amicable settlement between him and the complainant and that he also apologised for the offence. \nThe judge said in his order that the apology itself indicated that there was guilt in committing the said offence. \nThe bench said that in such cases, courts have to be conscious as to whether the offences, which are committed, carry a very wider social impact, which can disturb the basic secular fabric of the country. \nIf so, the said offence, said cannot be permitted to be compounded, the Court underscored.\n\"The criminal law of the country is deterrent in nature, in the sense that punishment contemplated in relation to the offences provided under the Indian Penal Code are not basically intended to punish an accused person, but rather to create an example for the others to learn a lesson and not to engage themselves in commission of such type of offences,\" the court opined.\nIf being a citizen under Article 5 of the Constitution of India, a person does not respect other religion, it may lead to a certain catastrophic situation which at time becomes uncontrollable by the administration and particularly so called constructed religious groups of the country, the judge observed. \n\"Though the offence under section 295A, seems to be quite simple in nature carrying a sentence of maximum period of three years, but looking to its wider social effect on the public and community at large, this Court is not inclined to compound the same,\" the judge added.  \nWith these observations, the bench dismissed the plea.\nAdvocates Harshpal Sekhon and Mohd Ahtesham appeared for the Appellant. \nAdvocates Manpreet Kaur Virk and Jasmeet Sahota appeared for the Complainant. \nDeputy Advocate General Amit Bhatt represented the State."}

Stressed Assets Stabilization Fund.\nIn V Padmakumar, the issue was whether reflection of debt in the books of accounts tantamounts to acknowledgment of debt under Section 18 of the Limitation Act, 1963, and thereby extends the period of limitation.\nWith a 4:1 majority, a five-member bench of NCLAT had held that reflection of debt in the balance sheet could not be considered as an acknowledgment of debt under Section 18 of the Limitation Act.\nThe majority concluded that the filing of balance sheet being mandatory under Section 92(4) of the Companies Act, 2013, it cannot be treated to be an acknowledgement under Section 18.\nIf the argument is accepted that the Balance Sheet of the ‘Corporate Debtor’ amounts to acknowledgement under Section 18 then in such case, it is to be held that no limitation would be applicable because every year, it is mandatory for the ‘Corporate Debtor’ to file Balance Sheet, the five-member Bench had ruled. \nIn September 2020, a three-member Bench doubted the correctness of the decision in V Padmakumar in another case and referred the matter to a five-member Bench to re-examine the correctness of V Padmakumar. \nThe five-member Bench however dismissed the same leading to the present appeal before the Supreme Court.\nThe top court placed reliance on a plethora of judgments including Mahabir Cold Storage v.

When the case came up post lunch, the counsel informed the Court about the surrender of the accused. \n\"In the second call, learned senior counsel has submitted, on instructions, that the petitioner has presented himself before Angamaly Police Station today but he could not go to the Trial Court in view of the prevailing situation of pandemic and lockdown,\" the order said. \nThe Court, therefore, agreed to issue notice in the matter while also directing that the petitioner be taken into custody and committed to prison. \nThe case dates back to March 2014 when Ratheesh attempted to kill one Rithin Rajan. \nHe was convicted under Section 307 (attempt to murder) and Section 324 (voluntary hurt using dangerous weapons) of India Penal Code by the Additional Sessions Judge, Paravur on October 31, 2017 and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. \nThe Kerala High Court on appeal suspended the sentence while granting bail to the petitioner in March 2018. \nOne of conditions for grant of bail was that he would not be involved in any criminal activities. \nBut the destruction of the movie set and another incident involving obstruction to traffic led to two FIRs registered against him. \nThe State and Rajan then preferred applications for cancellation of bail before the Kerala High Court which was allowed. \nRatheesh contended that the bail granted to him on March 21, 2018 was erroneously cancelled by the High Court on March 18 ,2021 “on absolutely flimsy grounds.”\nBasant told the Court that the two FIRs registered against Ratheesh after he was released on bail in 2018 had nothing to show that he individually committed any of those crimes so as to forfeit the indulgence granted by the Court.\nThe top court noted that though there was no deadline set by the High Court to surrender, but the “fact of the matter remains that the High Court had consciously cancelled the bail granted to him after taking into account the allegations of the State that after suspension of execution of sentence with the condition that he would not get involved in any other offence, the petitioner was found involved in the said two cases.”\nThe court therefore ordered that, “if has surrendered before the said Police Station, shall be taken into custody and committed to the prison.”\nHowever, the Court also clarified that this shall be without prejudice to the appeal preferred by him.\nThe matter will now be heard again on May 28 by a vacation bench."}

He was found to be carrying forged identification documents and an explosive substance.\nIn March 2021, he was convicted for the offence of waging war against the Government of India under section 121 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) by a Session Judge in Kolkata. He was also found guilty of other offences under the IPC as well as the Foreigners Act and the Explosive Substance Act and sentenced to life in jail along with fines.\nHe moved the High Court challenging this order of the Sessions Court.\nThe counsel for the appellant contended that a pre-deliberated First Information Report (FIR) was lodged against the appellant and he was falsely implicated and, hence, the order should be set aside.\nIt was also contended that one of the prosecution witnesses admittedly left the premises of the police station without a corresponding endorsement in the GDE book as per rules and therefore, his testimony cannot be relied upon.\nThe appellant has also challenged the independence of other witnesses. He claimed that they were pocket witnesses and a conviction on the basis of such partisan witnesses could not be said to be beyond all reasonable doubts. \nHe also assailed the judgment for the discrepancies in the investigation, claiming that the investigating agency omitted to obtain the call detail records (CDR) of the seized mobile phone. \nCertain contradictions in the testimonies of the prosecution were also pointed out by the counsel. It was contended that the quantity of the articles for chemical examination was not mentioned and, hence, the report by the chemical examiner stood vitiated.\nAdvocate for the State argued that the appellant was apprehended trying to proceed to Jammu & Kashmir with objectionable articles and fake documents in his possession.\nHe further contended that the accused failed to produce any valid document for his travel into Indian territory. Hence, he said that the sessions court judgment and order was based on unimpeachable evidence deserved to be upheld.\nThe Court noted that the convict during the trial, had not denied the fact that he was from Pakistan \nHence, the Court concluded that he was rightly held to be a Pakistani national and convicted under section 14A(b) of Foreigner's Act.\nFurther, it took into consideration the fact the convict was found in possession of a plastic container with what the chemical examiner found to be ammonium nitrate and petroleum hydrocarbon, two highly explosive substances.\n\"No explanation has been put forward by the appellant for the possession of highly explosive substance which is also not permitted. Such possession was, obviously, to endanger human life and property in the Indian Territory and that too, in a suspicious manner being carried in a bag,\" the Court added.\nTherefore, it do not find any illegality or irregularity in the conviction of the appellant for the offences punishable under Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Substance Act.\nFurther, the Court said that the circumstances of the case suggested that the accused's actions were within the ambit of an attempt to wage war upon the Government of India. \n\"Not only that, the appellant was moving in the garb of common Indian citizen having possession of objectionable materials and thereby otherwise preparing for waging war against Government of India. The circumstances points that the appellant was also guilty of concealing the design to wage war upon Indian Government,\" it said.\nTherefore, the Court upheld the life sentence awarded to the accused."}

This Court though takes note of the parent's decision to reach a settlement, it cannot condone a practice that treats a minor girl as a tradable commodity,” the judgment said.\nThe child and her younger brother was kidnapped in 2020. However, the boy was later returned to the parents. \nIn 2020, three accused Rubina, Nisha and Kapil Kumar were arrested in the case and the minor was recovered from them.\nThe investigation revealed that the girl child was allegedly kidnapped by Rubina and then sold for ₹20,000 to Nisha and Kapil. \nThe accused persons approached the Court seeking quashing of the criminal case on the ground that they had settled the matter with the minor’s parents. \nIt was also submitted that Nisha and Kapil did not know that the child was kidnapped and a lenient view may be taken since due to medical reasons, they were not able to produce a child of their own. \nThe parents of the minor girl have no objection if the couple legally adopt the child, the Court was further told. \nHowever, the Court rejected the argument for “humanitarian approach” as it opined that the same would be not only against the fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence but also legitimate expectations of the society to punish those who commit heinous offences.\nThe Court said that the case brings to light the critical question of “commodification of children” which goes against the moral values and ethical standards of the society.\nIt added that the idea that a girl child can be subjected to such a transaction where her custody is negotiated like property, challenges the very principles of rule of law.\nThe bench termed it unfortunate that the parents of the children wanted her to live with the kidnappers.\nIt added that the law cannot side with those who are on the opposite side of law. \n“The judges though faced with such dilemmas, have to still stand firm on the side of law; and while making every effort to balance the rights of victims, cannot lose sight of the larger implications of such settlements on the society as a whole,” the Court opined.\nThe Court also rejected the argument that child has become attached to her kidnappers. \n“The fact remains that they [accused] had got the child kidnapped, made payment of money to separate the child from the biological parents and her siblings, which is a crime under the law. In case lenient view is taken in such cases and FIRs are quashed on the basis of such agreements, it would amount to defeating the principles of criminal law, and in the process weakening the rule of law.”\nThe Court concluded that acceptance of such settlements could contribute to the perpetuation of a culture where the rights and dignity of children would be subjected to negotiation and compromise.\nQuashing criminal proceedings in such cases would send a message to society that the severity of crimes against children can be mitigated or overlooked through private agreements, the Court added.\nThus, it dismissed the petition. \nAdvocate RPS Bhati represented the accused\nAdvocate Naresh Kumar Chahar represented the State\nAdvocate Ashok Kumar Mahoor represented the other respondents."}

When the train stopped at the Vadodara Railway Station, a huge crowd had gathered.\nKhan threw ‘smiley balls’ and ‘t- shirts’ in the crowd and in trying to catch catch those, there was a scuffle.

The fact that the petitioner continued to hold the position as a Minister for nearly eight months and that to without a portfolio when he was inside the jail, shows the tremendous influence of the petitioner and the importance that is given to him by the State Government. Even if the petitioner had resigned from his position as a Minister, he continues as a MLA belonging to the same party which is running the Government in the State of Tamil Nadu and therefore, without any hesitation, this Court holds that the petitioner continues to wield a lot of influence on the Government.

Therefore, the Court examined the evidence on record in the case, in detail, to ascertain if the prosecution's allegations against the accused would stand. \nOn such examination, the top court found that \"there is a fair degree of uncertainty in the prosecution story\" and that the courts below appeared to have been influenced primarily by the oral testimony of two witnesses, without considering the effect of other surrounding circumstances. \nHaving considered such earlier ignored circumstances, the top court was of the view that the charge of murder against the accused-appellants was not proved beyond reasonable doubt. \nThe Supreme Court was hearing an appeal challenging a 2014 Allahabad High Court judgment affirming a 1986 trial court judgment convicting the appellant-accused. The case concerned the death of one, Narayan, who was murdered on September 5, 1985. \nFour men were initially accused of the offence. One of the accused died before the trial court took up the matter.

In 2014, the High Court confirmed the conviction of the remaining two accused.\nThe Supreme Court, on further appeal, observed that there was material to indicate that there was long-standing enmity between the deceased and the accused, leading to the possibility that the accused was falsely implicated. The top court further took note of several defects in the investigation of the case as well. \n\"The failure/neglect to seize the weapons of offence, on facts and in the circumstances of the present case, has the effect of denting the prosecution story so much so that the same, together with non-examination of material witnesses constitutes a vital circumstance amongst others for granting the appellants the benefit of doubt,\" the Court noted, in its judgment. \nFurther, the bench noted that the oral testimony of the witnesses in the case was not free from doubt either. \nSeveral key witnesses were not examined in the trial and there was some delay in examining the main prosecution witness, it was observed. Notably, the non-examination of the investigating officer in the case was also viewed as a material lacuna, all of which created reasonable doubts in the prosecution's case, the Supreme Court opined. \nHence, the apex court concluded that the case against the accused had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. The Court, therefore, acquitted the two accused and ordered their immediate release. \n\"For the reasons aforesaid, this Court is of the opinion that the charge that the appellants had murdered Narayan, cannot be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt; hence, they were and are entitled to the benefit of doubt,\" the Court said. \nAdvocate Mukesh Giri represented the appellants and advocate Sanjay Kumar Tyagi appeared for the respondents."}

We're of the view that the proposed amendment would not dilute the spirit and object of the cooling-off period, if implemented after an individual has completed two terms at either BCCI or State federations. We therefore accept this amendment.\"\nThis would mean that BCCI President Sourav Ganguly and Secretary Jay Shah will be able to continue in office.\nIn fact, the bench at the outset today noted the anomaly with the proposed amendments as they are currently worded, which would enable one to keep standing for State and BCCI administration posts provided they alternate every six years.\n\"Then that cycle will go on, two terms in each. We'll exclude that. We'll say someone from State association, as per what the SG was saying, can apply for two terms in BCCI. Else cooling off [will be] applied if someone has 6 years in either.\"\nIn its order, the bench also accepted amendments pertaining to replacing disqualifications of those with criminal charges (changed to those with convictions), and those from public office (to only include ministers and public servants). \nIt also allowed cricketers involved in other sports to contest polls for office-bearer posts.\nBackground and previous arguments\nThe Constitution drawn up based on the Justice RM Lodha Committee recommendations mandates that any individual, who has been an office bearer in any State cricket association or the BCCI or a combination of both for six years, should undergo a three-year cooling-off period before such person can contest to become an office bearer again.\nThis would mean that both Ganguly and Shah would have had to to demit office since both have completed six years, having earlier served as office bearers with the Cricket Association of Bengal and the Gujarat Cricket Association respectively.\nThe Supreme Court had in July appointed Senior Counsel and former Additional Solicitor General Maninder Singh as Amicus Curiae in the case.\nYesterday, the Bench had orally indicated that it would allow two consecutive terms for office-bearers of the BCCI and the State cricket associations before the three-year cooling-off period mandated by Justice Lodha committee kicks in.\nThe Court had, however, posed queries on the proposal regarding the need to do away with the 70-year age limit for office bearers and International Cricket Council (ICC) representatives, as well as those on doing away with disqualifications on having criminal charges and holding public office or controlling another sports' administrative body. \nToday's hearing\nJustice Kohli, after hearing Amicus Curiae Senior Advocate Maninder Singh, noted that a 12-year total term across BCCI and State associations would be possible as administrators can escape the cooling-off on switching to the BCCI.\n\"To address that concern, we can say after two State terms cooling off will be must, and after two State terms only one BCCI term can be allowed before cooling off,\" the Bench suggested.\nSolicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta argued that a BCCI office-bearer post is not a largesse but something that is won through election.\n\"They have to get confidence of voters, so a 6-year term is not long.\" \nThe Bench then suggested that after completing two terms, cooling-off periods of three years will be uniformly applied for that level. After 12 years, the period would be applicable for both State and BCCI posts, the judges orally indicated. \nOn the provision of anyone with criminal charges not being able to contest, the Bench remarked, \n\"We'll say convicted of offence not involving punishment of just a fine.\"\nAfter the counsel for the respondent continued voicing their opposition to the proposed amendments, the Bench raised a question of their locus standi and asked them for specific objections. \nAfter hearing him at length and calling his arguments 'spirited', Justice Chandrachud remarked,\n\"At the end of the day we have the highest respect for the [Lodha] committee, but we are not cricketers and are regulating the affairs of an autonomous body, and must give them leeway so long as they aren't going against the spirit of our judgment ... Indian cricket is successful not because of judicial review but because of its administration\". \nThe judgment\nThe Bench in its order discussed counsel's justification to do away with certain clauses through the proposed amendments that have been accepted. \nThe order notes that the allowing only those convicted to contest has been proposed, as opposed to those with charges, 'to protect office bearers who may suffer frivolous prosecution'. \nAlong with the same and the submission that disqualifications for holding public office should only apply for ministers and public servants, the Bench ruled,\n\"These changes do not detract from the spirit of our original judgment, and are hence accepted.\""}

Those applications were rejected by the CJM, Bhopal. \nRevision Applications were preferred by the appellants which were also rejected by the Sessions Court, Bhopal and the matter was carried to the High Court. \nThe High Court held that since the CJM, Bhopal had passed an appropriate order in March, 2014, the period available for the investigating machinery to complete the investigation stood extended to 180 days and as such the applications preferred by the appellants under Section 167(2) of the Code were not maintainable and that the appellants were not entitled to relief.\nThis led to the present appeal before the Supreme Court. \nSenior Advocate Siddhartha Dave appearing for the appellant-accused, relied upon the decision of the top court in Bikramjit Singh. He submitted that para 26 of the decision completely covers the issue and that the extension granted in the instant case by CJM, Bhopal was beyond jurisdiction and would, therefore, be of no consequence.\nThe Court proceeded to extract para 26 of Bikramjit Singh in its order which reads as follows:\n“26. Before the NIA Act was enacted, offences under the UAPA were of two kinds — those with a maximum imprisonment of over 7 years, and those with a maximum imprisonment of 7 years and under. Under the Code as applicable to offences against other laws, offences having a maximum sentence of 7 years and under are triable by the Magistrate’s courts, whereas offences having a maximum sentence of above 7 years are triable by Courts of Session. This scheme has been completely done away with by the NIA Act, 2008 as all Scheduled Offences i.e. all offences under the UAPA, whether investigated by the National Investigation Agency or by the investigating agencies of the State Government, are to be tried exclusively by Special Courts set up under that Act. In the absence of any designated court by notification issued by either the Central Government or the State Government, the fallback is upon the Court of Session alone. Thus, under the aforesaid scheme what becomes clear is that so far as all offences under the UAPA are concerned, the Magistrate’s jurisdiction to extend time under the first proviso in Section 43-D(2)(b) is non-existent, “the Court” being either a Sessions Court, in the absence of a notification specifying a Special Court,or the Special Court itself.”\nIn view of the same, the Court allowed the appeal and held that the appellants are entitled to be released on default bail.\n\"The appellants be produced before the concerned Trial Court within three days from today and the Trial Court, shall release them on bail subject to such conditions as the Trial Court may deem appropriate to impose to ensure their presence and participation in the pending trial,\" the Court ordered."}

{"id": "id_120", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court on Friday ruled that children born out of void or voidable marriages can claim a right in their parents' ancestral property in joint Hindu families following the Mitakshara system of law. [Revanasiddappa and Anr v. Mallikarjun and Ors]\nA Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra held that a child under Section 16(1) and Section 16(2) of Hindu Marriage Act (HMA) would be a legitimate kin under the Hindu Succession Act (HSA).\nThe Court also said that Section 6 of the HSA, which deals with interest in coparcenary property, lays down a legal fiction that coparcenary property would be treated as if partition had taken place.\nConsequently, the Court opined that the provisions of the HSA have to be harmonised with those of the HMA to ensure that a child under Section 16(1) and (2) of the HMA has a right in the property of their parents.\nIt was clarified that children from void/voidable marriages will, however, not have the rights to or in the property of any other person in the family.\nThe top court in its judgment made it clear that a child born from a void/voidable marriage does not ipso facto become a coparcener (meaning joint heir in Hindu law) in the Hindu Mitakshara Joint Family. \n\"The basic principle which governs such an HUF is that a coparcener holds a property in common with others. The birth of a person who is a coparcener leads to the acquisition of an interest in the coparcenary property. Shares are liable to increase with birth and reduce with the death of a coparcener,\" the Court said. \nAs a result of the substitution of Section 6(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act, devolution of the share of a Hindu male coparcener in the property of a Hindu Undivided Family governed by Mitakshara law upon death takes place not by survivorship but by testamentary or intestate succession, the Court further explained. \n\"Section 6(3) has therefore after its substitution provides for devolution by testamentary or intestate succession under the Act and not by survivorship. Section 6 however, continues to recognize the existence of Mitakshara Hindu Joint families.\"\nBackground\nThe Supreme Court had reserved its verdict in the matter on August 18.\nIt had been called on to decide whether the share of children born out of void or voidable marriages is limited only to the self-acquired property of their parents under Section 16(3) of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nSection 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act presumes the legitimacy of children born from marriages that are null and void under Section 11 of the Act.\nHowever, Section 16(3) states that the same shall not be construed as conferring upon any such children rights in or to the property of any person, other than the parents, in cases where they would not be capable of possessing or acquiring any such rights in the absence of the Act.\nThe matter was referred to a three-judge bench after two contrasting opinions were rendered on the topic by coordinate benches of the Supreme Court.\nIn Bharatha Matha and anr v.

However, it noted that the child was receiving treatment from a team of specialty doctors and that this itself was a \"concession\" granted to her.

As medical professionals, they are thriving hard and providing treatment to the child. When the Doctors are treating the child by following the medical protocol and ethics, there is no reason to interfere with such treatments or otherwise by the High Court. More so, the petitioner cannot expect any such preference only for her child as there are many children also, taking treatment in the Government Hospitals,\" the Court said. \nThe Court clarified that the petitioner can avail of medical facilities available in government hospitals on par with other children.

{"id": "id_127", "reference_summary": "In two judgments passed on October 16, the Punjab and Haryana High Court clarified crucial aspects concernng the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA). \nThe judgments were pronounced by a Bench of Justices Dr S Muralidhar and Avneesh Jhingan.\nThe two judgments answered the following questions, among others:\nWhether there is an overlap between the powers of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (the Authority) and the Adjudicating Officer (AO)?\nWhether remedies under the RERA may be pursued along with those under the Consumer Protection Act?\nCan the Authority be manned by a single member?\nJudgment 1: Experion Developers Pvt. Ltd. v. State of Haryana and Ors. \nWhether there is an overlap between the powers of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (the Authority) and the Adjudicating Officer (AO)?\nHarmoniously construing Section 71 with Sections 12, 14, 18, and 19 of the RERA, the High Court ruled that the AO could determine rates of compensation and interest payable upon a default by a promoter of a housing project. \nSection 71, which delineates the scope of the AO's authority, states that the scope of an AO's authority was to adjudge compensation or interest. Only the promoter could be proceeded against when the AO was approached, the Court emphasized.\nIf the homebuyer wished for further remedies, he would have to approach the Authority, who was endowed with a wider range of powers under the legislation under Sections Sections 31, 34 (f), Sections 35, 36 and 37. The remedy could be sought against a promoter, an allottee of a house, or a real estate agent as was required. The Act gave the Authority the trappings of a Court, and authorised it to issue directions and interim orders, the Court expounded. \nHowever, it was not a substitute for the High Court, though the Chief Justice of the High Court would have the authority to appoint the Chairperson (who did not have to have legal knowledge). The Court emphasized that the scheme of the legislation made the decision of the Authority subordinate to the Appellate Tribunal and the High Court. Therefore, its orders were subject to judicial review, it was concluded.\nThe Act requires the AO to be a retired or sitting district judge, the Court underscored.\nQuelling the contention that the powers of the AO and the Authority could overlap, the Court reasoned that a person who sought compensation alone would approach the AO. The AO would then decide whether there was a contract between the promoter and the homebuyer/allottee before determining compensation.\nWhere there was an omnibus relief sought, the Court stated that the homebuyer could approach the Authority, who would then refer the question concerning compensation to the AO. The preliminary question of whether there was a valid contract between the allottee and the promoter/real estate agent would first be decided by the Authority before referring the limited question of compensation to the AO, the Bench elaborated.\nWhether remedies under the RERA may be pursued along with those under the Consumer Protection Act?\nTaking the aid of Section 88 of the RERA, the Bench stated that remedies under RERA and the Consumer Protection Act could be pursued simultaneously. \nSection 88 of the RERA clarifies that its provisions would be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the provisions of other laws in force.\nHowever, the Court sounded a note of caution on this question, particularly on the aspect of remedies being pursued before the AO.\nIf the allottee withdrew his complaint before the Consumer Forum and presented before the AO, he would only be entitled to compensation/interest, as opposed to obtaining a refund/other reliefs.\nJudgment 2: Janta Land Promoters Private Limited v. Union of India and Ors.\nCan the Authority be manned by a single member?\nThe Court ruled that there was no provision in the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, which envisaged either the Authority or the Appellate Tribunal to function with a single member while exercising quasi-judicial or adjudicatory functions.\nBasing its conclusion on Sections 20(2), 21, and 29, the Court ruled that the adjudicatory power of the Authority could not be transferred to a single member without express provision in the Act.\nSimilarly referring to Section 43, the Court declared that an Appellate Tribunal was to have at least two members, one of whom was to be a judicial and other a technical or administrative member.\nBecause the order appealed from as well as the original orders were passed by one-man fora, the High Court nulled them and remanded the matter back to the Authority for fresh consideration. \nA Punjab RERA Regulation that permitted a Single Member to exercise adjudicatory powers was also adjudged to be void.\nRead the Judgments:"}

Suspicions would arise that the same networks may have been involved. There is no gainsaying that the girls were rescued from the brothel where the applicant was also soliciting customers. It becomes a matter of concern, for she too could try to reach out to the prosecutrix to try and influence her and/or prevent her from testifying before the court\", the Court observed.\nTherefore, the Court rejected the bail application saying,\n\"In the light of the foregoing discussion and particularly in view of the serious nature of allegations and the fact that the prosecutrix is yet to be examined by the learned Trial Court, no ground is made out for grant of interim bail to the applicant\""}

The High Court confirmed the conviction but commuted the death to life imprisonment;\n- The State appealed to the Supreme Court which confirmed the conviction. The matter was, however, remitted to the High Court to reconsider the question of sentence;\n- In this second round, the High Court found that the entire case rested on circumstantial evidence;\n- It was noted that the DNA samples indicated false implication and that the two criminals who seemed to have actually committed the offence were not booked;\n- Thus, the case was directed to be re-opened, and the DLSA was asked to appeal against the conviction;\n- The High Court also commuted the death penalty of the convict to life imprisonment. \nIn a detailed judgment, the Court pointed out various instances during the investigation that indicated the false implication of the accused.\nHowever, having been directed by the Supreme Court to confine its decision to the question of sentence, the Bench could not reverse the conviction.\n“We with heavy heart and with hope that justice would be done to the accused, who has been sentenced to imprisonment till death for crime committed by two other persons, commute sentence from death penalty to life imprisonment.”\nThe High Court began by examining precedents related to death penalty at length, and discussed reasons that could be considered for converting death penalty to life imprisonment. \nIt held that the Court should consider the cumulative effects of both aggravating and mitigating circumstances in order to strike a balance between the two.\nThe bench noted that the entire case was based on circumstantial evidence. It was taken into account that reliance had been placed by the court on the DNA report as per which, the DNA profiles of two males was obtained from the leggings of the victim. \nThe same profiles were also obtained from the underwear of the accused. However, it did not match that of the accused’s blood sample. \n“The two male DNA profile obtained from the leggings of the deceased did not match with the DNA profile of the blood sample taken from the accused, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the above is that the two criminals who actually committed the crime were not booked by the police,” the Bench observed.\nThe High Court also took into account that the accused was not given an opportunity to explain his DNA report.\nAdditionally, it was considered that as per the school record of the accused he was a minor at the time of the offence, he did not have any criminal background and had shown good conduct in jail.\n“The State has not come up with any material to show that the accused is a threat to the society or that he cannot be reformed.”\nIn this light, the cardinal rule of criminal law that a hundred guilty may be acquitted, but one innocent should not be held guilty was highlighted by the Bench.\nIt was stated that this rule was followed to ensure that overzealous prosecution did not result in the conviction of an innocent man.\n“The reason for this is to ensure that the police and prosecution do their job right, and to ensure that an overzealous prosecution does not result in an innocent man being convicted of a crime, he did not commit, otherwise people would not have faith and respect for the justice delivery system,” the Court said. \nThe High Court was of the opinion that the two who had committed the crime shifted blame to the accused with the help of the police.\nIn fact, it was underscored that material facts regarding the age of the accused and the DNA evidence were not brought to the apex court’s attention, and no assistance was provided to the appellant before the top court.\nTherefore, the Secretary of the Rajasthan State Legal Services Authority was directed to appeal against the previous judgment of the High Court converting the accused’s death sentence to life imprisonment.\nFurther, the Bench in the instant case directed the Jhalawar Superintendent of Police to reopen the matter and investigate afresh the two accused whose DNA samples were obtained from the leggings of the victim.\nThe High Court ordered that appropriate action should be initiated against those who booked the accused belonging to a backward class, and had no means to defend his case.\n“Superintendent of Police, Jhalawar, should submit report of the action taken by him within two months of the date of this order”.\nHowever, owing to its limited jurisdiction, the Court only commuted the death penalty awarded to the accused, to life imprisonment.\nAdvocate Nitin Jain appeared for the accused pro bono (without payment).

The State of West Bengal & Anr]\nThe Court found that the woman (prosecutrix) had voluntarily entered into a sexual relationship with him because she was in love with him and desired it and “not because he promised to marry her\". \nRelying on various case laws, the Court observed that the consent given by a woman for sexual intercourse with a man with whom she is deeply in love with on a promise that he would marry her on a later date “cannot be said to be given under a misconception of fact.”\n“In plethora of judgments of Supreme Court and High Court have held that consent given by the prosecutrix to sexual intercourse with a person with whom she is deeply in love on a promise that he would marry her on a later date, cannot be said to be given under a misconception of fact,” the judgment delivered on February 24 stated.\nThe bench of Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Ajay Kumar Gupta was dealing with a case involving allegations that the accused man had assaulted and driven away his partner (prosecutrix) after she became pregnant and gave birth to his child. The child later passed away.\nThe Court remarked that while it may be morally reprehensible that the accused had deserted the prosecutrix after she became pregnant, such moral indignation alone is not sufficient to make out a case against the accused if there was nothing to prove any dishonest intention on his part.\nRather, on an examination of the submissions made by the parties, the Court opined that it appeared to be a voluntary affair between the accused and the prosecutrix.\n“No doubt it is morally reprehensible for the appellant to desert the victim lady with whom he had entered into an informal marriage after she had become pregnant. But moral indignation cannot take the place of legal proof that the cohabitation of the parties was on the basis of a dishonest representation of the appellant. Even for arguments sake it is accepted the appellant had committed a breach of promise that by itself cannot give rise to an inference that he entertained dishonest intention at the inception of the relationship. On the other hand, it appears parties cohabited under an informal arrangement and subsequently the appellant refused to formalise the relationship which resulted in the institution of the criminal case. These circumstances do not persuade this Court to hold cohabitation was on the basis of dishonest representation”, the Court found.\nThe prosecutrix had asserted that they had been cohabiting together after the accused promised to marry her. A complaint earlier filed by the woman against the accused had been withdrawn after the accused promised to marry her, she submitted further.\nDuring their cohabitation, the accused was also stated to have symbolically married the woman by putting vermillion on her forehead. However, he later refused to enter into a formal marriage and drove her away, the Court was told.\nThe Court, however, took note that the prosecutrix and the accused had been cohabiting for a considerable period of time before misunderstandings cropped up between them, leading to their split as the accused was unwilling to formally marry the woman. \nThe Court held that it could not be readily inferred that the earlier cohabitation between the parties was based on a false promise of marriage.\nThe bench further opined that the woman was old enough and intelligent enough to understand “the significance and moral quality of the act she was consenting to” when she cohabited with the accused and had a physical relation with him.  \n“That is why she kept it a secret as long as she could. It appears that the matter got complicated on account of the prosecutrix becoming pregnant,” the Court added.\nThe Court concluded that the prosecutrix had voluntarily and consciously consented to have sexual intercourse with the accused and that her consent was not a result of any misconception of fact.\n“In the instant case, the prosecutrix was a grown up lady aged about 26 years at the time of incident and she and the appellant were in physical relation. They have made sexual intercourseon several occasions in the residence of victim lady as well as the appellant. The circumstances clearly indicate that the prosecutrix willingly consented to having sexual intercourse with the appellant with whom she was in love, not because he promised to marry her, but because she also desired it,” the Court found.\nHence, the Court proceeded to acquit the appellant-accused and set aside the conviction awarded to him by a Sessions Court.\nAdvocates Prabir Majumder, Snehansu Majumder, Avisek Chatterjee, and Sangeeta Chakraborty appeared for the appellant.

{"id": "id_1300", "reference_summary": "The Kerala High Court recently observed that unhealthy, unscientific and deleterious practices must be prevented even if they are done for religious purposes [Raveendran PT v. State of Kerala & Ors.],\nIn this regard, single-judge Justice VG Arun highlighted the words of Dr. BR Ambedkar on true religious practice.\n\"As opined by none other than Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, true religious practice should be guided by reason, equality and humanistic values, rather than blind adherence to traditions. All unhealthy, unscientific and deleterious practices are to be prevented, even if it is done in the name of religion,\" the Court said.\nFurther, the Court held that animal sacrifice done under the pretext of religious practice is one such practice that needs to be curbed especially when it causes nuisance to others.\n\"Going by the precedents and on a proper understanding of the rights under Article 25 and the liberty guaranteed under Article 21, the contention that, animal sacrifice being an essential and integral part of the 8th respondent's religious belief and practice, cannot be interfered with even if it causes nuisance to others, has to be rejected,\" the order stated.\nJustice Arun also pointed out that India has historically enacted laws to prevent and prohibit objectionable ritualistic practices like Sati, human sacrifice and child marriage. \n\"No doubt, Article 25 of the Constitution grants all persons the right to freely profess, practice and propagate religion. A careful reading of Article 25 shows that the above mentioned freedom is subject to public order, morality, health and the other provisions of Part III. As such, the freedom and right under Article 25 are subservient to the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed under Article 21. Being so, the expression of religious freedom by the conduct of poojas and rituals by the petitioner (sic) cannot result in the deprivation of the right to decent living guaranteed to the other residents\", the Court said in its order\nThe Court made the observations while considering a plea moved by a man seeking to stop the illegal slaughter of birds and animals in the guise of ritualistic sacrifice by the party-respondent. The objectionable activities were allegedly carried out in a structure resembling a temple, constructed by the respondent on the second floor of his residential building. \nThe petitioner submitted that the respondent exhibited a board with the name 'Sree Bhramarambika Vishnumayaswam Devasthanam' and was canvassing devotees through notices and other modes of advertisement. \n\"The 8th respondent is conducting poojas and rituals in his building day-in and day-out, accompanied by the ringing of bells, blowing of the conch and the shrieks and cries of animals and birds. The blood of the slaughtered animals is flown to the road and carcasses strewn all over the place,\" the petitioner's submissions as recorded in the order said. \nIt was contended that the construction was illegal as it was done without obtaining permission under the Kerala Panchayat Building Rules, the Manual of Guidelines to Prevent and Control Disturbances and to Promote Communal Harmony, 2005. \nMoreover, the ritualistic sacrifice of animals violates the provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act and the Kerala Animals and Birds Sacrifices Prohibition Act, it was submitted. \nThe petitioner further alleged that the police and the Panchayat officials were not taking any action against the respondent despite being aware of the issues.\nThe State government and the Panchayat confirmed that there are issues but submitted that the respondent has been unwilling to co-operate in spite of mass complaints.\nThe respondent, on the other hand, maintained that the from of worship he conducts, which follows the Shaktheyam ritualistic method using pancha makaram, viz; liquor, fish, meat, mudra and midhunam, is an essential part of his religious belief and cannot be interfered with in view of the guarantees under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. He contended that the permissions that the petitioner says he was supposed to receive do not apply to him as he is conducting religious activities inside his pooja room and that he is not canvassing devotees.\nOn examining the statutes cited and several precedents of the Supreme Court relevant to the subject, the Court failed to find favour with any of the grounds raised by the respondent to justify his actions. \nThe Court made particular note of the allegation of the petitioner that in spite of being informed about the construction of a religious place without prior permission, the District Authorities and the police are refusing to take action.\nThe Court took a very dim view of the inaction by the police and the panchayat authorities saying,\n\"It is disconcerting to note the weak-kneed and jittery approach of the police and revenue authorities, when illegalities committed under the garb of religion are brought to their notice. The authorities should be mindful of the fact that the laws of this country are equally applicable to all citizens and no special treatment can be meted out to any person on religious grounds.The Panchayat is also at fault for having failed to act after seeking explanation, finding the petitioner to have effected construction in violation of the provisions of the Kerala Panchayat Raj Act and the Panchayat Building Rules.\"\nIt, therefore, issued directions to the police and panchayat authorities to take steps to address the situation."}

Further, it was pointed out that the party published the details in newspapers which are of low circulation in derogation of the Court's order.\nThe Court accepted the same stating,\n\"It is undisputed that the party has given identical reasons for selection of 5 of its candidates and has also filled Form C2 in a mechanical manner.\"\nIndian National Congress (₹ 1 lakh fine)\nThe petitioner pointed out that criminal antecedents were published in newspapers which are of low circulation and that the forms in which details of criminal antecedents have to be published have been filled in a mechanical manner. \nThe Amicus Curiae said party has given reasons along the lines of ‘winnability’ for the selection of candidates that have been accused of serious offences such as Section 307, Indian Penal Code and Section 506, Indian Penal Code.\nThe Court said that the party has not complied with the directions of the Bench in letter and spirit and is liable for contempt of court. \nBJP (₹ 1 lakh fine)\nThe petitioner contended that criminal antecedents were published in newspapers which are of low circulation and that the forms in which details of criminal antecedents have to be published have been filled in a mechanical manner.\nThe Amicus Curiae pointed out that the party provided reasons for selection of candidates, by referring to serious offences such as offences under Section 386 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code and portraying them as cases that were of a trivial nature.\n\"We are of the view that the reason given by the party for failing to submit Form C-7 in respect of one of its candidates is not acceptable and that the party has not provided reasons for selection of its candidates which are in line with our directions,\" the Court ruled holding the party guilty of contempt of court. \nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) [₹5 lakh fine]\nThe Election Commission pointed out that the party is one of the two parties that has not submitted the Form C7 or C8 for any of its candidates and therefore is fully non-compliant with top court's February 2020 order.\nSenior Advocate PV Surendranath, appearing on behalf of CPI(M) submitted that the election process for the State of Bihar was coordinated by the State Committee of the party and that Form C7 and C8 were not submitted due to oversight on part of the State Committee. He further submitted that the party has attempted to comply with the directions of this Court insofar as declaration of information regarding criminal cases in newspapers and the website of the party is concerned and that the aforementioned act of non-compliance should be viewed as an isolated incident and its unconditional apology be accepted.\nThe Court, however, refused stating that oversight on part of the State Committee of the party cannot be a ground for non-compliance of the directions passed by the Court. \nNationalist Congress Party (₹5 lakh fine)\nLike CPI(M), NCP also failed to submit the Form C7 and C8 for all its candidates. \nThe party submitted that its State committee was dissolved few months prior to the election and that was the reason for non-compliance. \nThe Court, however, declined to accept the same and held it to be guilty of contempt of court.\nCommunist Party of India (₹ 1 lakh fine)\nThe petitioner pointed out that criminal antecedents of candidates were published in newspapers of low circulation and that the forms in which details of criminal antecedents have to be published were filled in a mechanical manner.\nThe Amicus Curiae pointed out that the party, in order to flout our directions, justified selection of some candidates who have been accused of serious offences such as offences under Section 307, Indian Penal Code and Section 506, Indian Penal Code by stating that the cases “do not have any substance”.\nThe Court concurred stating that the party has not followed the directions in letter and spirit."}

The evidence discloses that the conspiracy was to attack certain religious leaders. The respondent has not spelt out how that would amount to a terrorist act as defined under Section 15 of the UA (P) Act. In order to bring an act under Section 15 of the UA (P) Act, the act must be done with an intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security, economic security, or sovereignty of India or with an intent to strike terror or likely to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country. The question as to whether the killing of Hindu religious leaders by itself can constitute a terrorist act is debatable. However, considering the broad probabilities of the case from the materials collected by the prosecution, one cannot definitely conclude that there was a conspiracy to commit a terrorist act, though there is a conspiracy to commit other illegal acts including serious offences,” the High Court said.\nThe Court, however, went on to say that its observations with regard to a prima facie case under Section 18 and 38(2) of the Act had been made by considering only the broad possibilities of the case for the mere purpose of considering the bail application.\nIt also took note of the fact that there was no clarity on whether the police had acquired requisite sanction for prosecuting the accused within seven days of the Investigating Officer having acquired evidence, as mandated under the Act.\nThe Court said that while the validity of such sanction will be looked into at the time of trial, any delay caused in getting it however, was an adequate ground to waive the prohibition on bail that Section 43 D(5) of the Act imposes.\n\"Even assuming that the materials collected by the prosecution may ultimately lead to a conviction, the detention pending trial cannot be indefinite,” the Court said while allowing the bail application.\nSenior Counsel T Mohan and advocate S Veeraraghavan appeared for Asif Musthaheen, the appellant in the case.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor A Gokulakrishnan appeared for the respondent state government."}

Therefore, he asked the Court to order re-examination of the prosecutrix.\nAt the outset, the Court noted that right to cross-examination is a part of right to fair trial which every person has in the spirit of right to life and personal liberty.\nMoreover, relying heavily on the decision of the Supreme Court in Natasha Singh v.

State of Kerala].\nThe judgment was delivered by Justice Anu Sivaraman in a petition moved by a transwoman, Hina Haneefa challenging Section 6 of the National Cadet Corps Act, 1948 that effectively allowed only 'males' or 'females' to enrol as cadets with NCC.\nHaneefa had applied for entry on the basis of her self-perceived gender, i.e to female category, since the NCC did not have provision for third gender. \n\"I am of the opinion that the petitioner who had opted for female gender and has undergone sex-reassignment surgery for aiding her self-perception would definitely be entitled to enrolment in NCC unit reckoning her as a transgender and further as a member of her self-perceived gender, i.e female gender,\" the Court ruled. \nIt further held that the provisions of the NCC Act cannot preclude the operations of the provisions of Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019 Act and the situation has to be viewed in the light of 2019 Act which recognises the right of transgender persons to a life with dignity and prohibits discrimination against them. \nThe fact that the provisions of the NCC Act do not recognise the third gender or that the detailed guidelines are required to be drawn up for integration of the persons of the third gender into the Armed Forces or the NCC cannot be a justification for denying admission to the petitioner to the NCC unit on the basis of the identity card obtained by her, the Court added. \n\"In the instant case, I am of the opinion that the petitioner is entitled to enrolment in NCC, Senior Girls Division and rejection of her request for the same is unsustainable,\" the Court held. \nThe Court has directed that Haneefa be allowed to participate in the selection process on the basis of her application already submitted. The Court has also directed the Centre to amend its enrolment criteria under Section 6 of the NCC Act and to issue guidelines to the entry of transgender persons within six months' time. \nDuring earlier hearings, the High Court had taken exception to the stance taken by the Central government that it cannot admit Transgender persons to National Cadet Corps (NCC) since only males and females are eligible for the same. \nThe delay in making requisite changes invited strong observations from Justice Anu Sivaraman who said that the government is duty-bound to comply with the 2014 Supreme Court judgment of NALSA v. Union of India in this regard.\nIn the petition filed through Advocates Raghul Sudheesh, CR Sudheesh, Lakshmi J, Glaxon KJ and Sanish Sasi Raj, the petitioner had challenged her exclusion from the NCC as arbitrary.\nIn the petition, it was emphasized that the inclusion of sexual minorities such as transgender persons is necessary to address the rampant marginalisation and discrimination faced by them.\nThe petitioner who was assigned male gender at birth had undergone two sex reassignment surgeries and obtained a transgender identity card under the Kerala government's Transgender Policy, 2015.\nThe petitioner, who identified herself as a woman, claimed that she should be admitted to NCC either as third gender (transgender) or as female which was her self-perceived gender identity. \nApart from a declaration from the court that Section 6 of the NCC Act is unconstitutional, the petitioner also urged the Court's intervention to allow her to be part of the enrollment process this year as interim relief.\nThe petitioner, presently a student at University College, Trivandrum had further sought a direction to the NCC to suitably amend their enrollment criteria.\nThe NCC and Central government had opposed the plea stating that the Act contemplates an advisory committee and any changes to NCC have to be deliberated and decided by the committee.\n“We are not saying that Transgender persons will not be included at any time. We say that only after due deliberations we can include them,” he said.\nThe NCC in its affidavit had also stated that it is empowered to enroll only those students as NCC cadets who meet the eligibility criteria as stipulated in Section 6 of the NCC Act, 1948 i.e. male & female gender only. It said that as per Section 6(2) only a student of female sex of any University or school could offer herself for enrolment as a cadet in the girls’ division.\nThe petitioner in this case exhausted her right to enrol per her self-‘perceived’ gender, that is, as a female because she was enrolled at university as a transgender (female), it was contended. Because she enrolled in her University as a Transgender, she is precluded from applying as a cadet in the girls division, the Centre added.\nThe NCC counsel also maintained that it is the prerogative of the NCC to decide when Transgender persons should be allowed admission.\n“Yes, we want them to be at the forefront to defeat Bhishmacharya but it is our prerogative at what time we have to make our relevant (unclear)” he said.\nHowever, the Bench had disagreed stating that it is not the Centre's prerogative in the light of the judgment of the apex court which is binding and has to be complied with."}

The so called morality is created by society, based on their own ethos and norms and should not necessarily reflect in a contextual relationship between the parent and child,\" the order stated.\nThe Court was hearing a plea by a father against a trial court order which refused to grant interim custody of his minor daughter to him and his parents.\nThe petitioner-father had married the respondent-mother in 2008 and a child was born from their wedlock in 2012. After matrimonial disputes arose between the two, they parted ways and the child continued to be in the custody of the mother.\nThe father filed a petition under Section 25 of the Guardian and Wards Act seeking custody of the minor daughter. While disposing of an application for interim custody, the trial held that no ground was made out for handling over the custody of the minor daughter to the father. However, visitation rights were granted to the petitioner-father.\nBefore the High Court, the parties alleged bad behaviour on the part of the other.\nAfter hearing the contentions, the Court observed that the matter is to be decided not on the consideration of the legal rights of the parties, but on the criterion of what would be in the best interests of the child.\n\"When the couples at loggerheads and want to part ways, they may level extreme allegations against each other, so as to depict the other unworthy, to have the custody of the child. In the circumstances, unless and until, there is proven bad conduct of one of the parent, which makes him/her unworthy to claim the custody of the child concerned, the question can and shall be decided, solely looking into the question as to, 'What would be the best interest of the child concerned',\" the Court observed.\nGiven that the child is now 10-11 years old, the mother can be the best friend, guide and mentor for the growing daughter, the Court observed. It als noted that at this stage, the child requires the assistance of her mother more than that of her father.\nWhile directing that the child remains in the custody of her mother, the Court increased the number of days the father is allowed to visit the child from once a month to twice a month.\n\"...during the course of such meetings, it is expected and desired from both the parties to extend cooperation to each other and create congenial atmosphere for the child to have healthy interaction with the petitioner,\" the Court clarified."}

It was submitted that once a conscious decision was taken by the State, it cannot be said that there was any clerical mistake that could have been corrected in exercise of the powers under Section 10 of the 1948 Act.\nThe Supreme Court noted that the earlier notification specifically stated that it has been issued in exercise of powers conferred by the 1948 Act. Moreover, it was also noted that this notification was issued in consultation with the Minimum Wage Advisory Board and thereafter, only the minimum wages were revised under Section 4 after following the due procedure under Section 5 of the 1948 Act.\nIn this backdrop, the Bench observed that:\n\"Once the minimum wages were revised and determined, which included the basic rates of wages and the special allowance as per Section 4(1)(i) of the Act, 1948, thereafter it cannot be said that there was any clerical and/or arithmetical mistake in mentioning clause (i). The minimum wages were revised and determined even after consultation with the Minimum Wage Advisory Board as required under Section 5 of the Act 1948. Therefore, once there was no mistake, the same could not have been corrected in exercise of powers under Section 10 of the Act 1948.\"\nAccordingly, the Court was of the view that in the instant case, a conscious decision was taken by the State Government after consultation with the Minimum Wage Advisory Board to issue the earlier notification and therefore, it cannot be said that there was any arithmetical and/or clerical mistake, which could have been corrected in exercise of powers under Section 10 of the 1948 Act.\nTherefore, the Court was of the view that the notification was wholly without jurisdiction and contrary to the relevant provisions of the 1948 Act.\nConsequently, the appeal was allowed and the earlier notification was restored."}

The CBI then opened a criminal enquiry against several former law enforcement officials allegedly involved in the police frame-up.\nThe CBI had after examining the Jain panel report, filed a First Information Report (FIR) marked as classified in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate, Thiruvananthapuram in July this year.\nOn July 26, 2021, Justices AM Khanwilkar and Sanjiv Khanna of the Supreme Court had ordered that after registration of FIRs, the CBI must collect evidence on its own and not \"merely\" rely on the report of the Justice DK Jain Committee that had earlier looked into the alleged police cover-up.\nThe four accused had later approached the Kerala High Court for relief which was allowed. \nDuring the hearing of the appeal before the top court.

In this regard, the Court also noted that wearing of masks is encouraged even within the home if there are elderly persons or persons with co-morbidities. As such, it was held that \"a vehicle even if constituted by one person would constitute a public place.. wearing of mask would be compulsory.\"\n\"Wearing of a mask of a face cover in a vehicle, which may be occupied by either a single person or multiple persons, is... compulsory in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the order further said.\nThe judgement was passed by a Single Judge Bench of Justice Prathiba M Singh in a batch of petitions challenging the imposition of fines on those driving alone in their cars while not wearing a mask.

She further alleged that because of this affair, her husband drove her out of her matrimonial house.\nThe Court after hearing the rival contentions noted hat the children had supported the father's claims against the mother. \n\"The conduct of the wife which has been projected and incidentally the children, who have supported such fact against the mother that she without the knowledge of her husband has done away with the security of the marriage of the daughter and has obtained amount from the creditor by pledging the ornaments meant for the marriage of the daughter would certainly cause apprehension & fear and create financial pressure on the mind of the father as we cannot also forget the hard reality which exists in the society to present a girl during the marriage with ornaments,\" the Court observed. \nHence, if a spouse pledges such ornaments to avail loans without informing the husband, the same would fall within the ambit of mental cruelty, the Court stated. \n\"Consequently, if a spouse by her own conduct, in such a way without caring about the future of the daughter, parts with the ornaments which were meant for the marriage, it will be within the ambit of mental cruelty done by the wife,\" the Court ruled.\nThe Court, therefore, allowed the plea and granted on the ground of cruelty stated in Section 13(1)(i-a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.\nAdvocate Shailendra Bajpai appeared for the husband while the wife was represented by advocate Palash Rajani."}

Indian judge at ICJ Justice Dalveer Bhandari voted in favour of the provisional measure.\nThe Court further indicated that any military or irregular armed units which may be directed or supported by Russia, as well as any organizations and persons which may be subject to its control, direction or influence, take no steps in furtherance of the military operations. \nThe Court, however, refused to indicate the Russian Federation to provide a report to the Court on measures taken to implement the Court’s order on provisional measures, as sought by Ukraine. \nThe Court emphasised that a State, in discharging its duty to prevent genocide, could act only within the limits of international law, and the acts taken by contracting parties to prevent and punish genocide must be in conformity with the spirit of the United Nations. \nNoting that there was not enough evidence substantiating the allegations of the Russian government that genocide was committed on Ukrainian territory, it was found that Ukraine had a plausible right not to be subjected to military operations by the Russian federation for the purpose of preventing an alleged genocide. \nThe Court also expressed its regret at the decision of the Russian Federation to not participate in the oral proceedings before the ICJ. \n\"The non-appearance of a party has a negative impact on the sound administration of justice as it deprives the Court of assistance a party could have provided to it,\" the Court said.\nIt was stated that at the present stage the Court was not required to ascertain whether any violation of obligations under the Genocide Convention had occurred in the dispute. \n\"Such a finding could be made by the Court only at the stage of examination of the merits of the present case,\" it was stated.\nWith this, the Court took a view that the acts complained of by the applicant appeared to be capable of falling within the Genocide Convention. \nThus, it prima facie had jurisdiction to entertain the case and could not accede to the Russian Federation's request that the case be removed from the general list for manifest lack of jurisdiction. \nThe ICJ heard on 7 March, Ukraine's application seeking a declaration that the claims of genocide as alleged by Russia within Ukrainian oblasts (areas) of Luhansk and Donetsk are false. Russia had defended its military action on this ground. Ukraine also sought reparations for damages caused by Russian military action.\nThe ICJ was called upon to urgently indicate provisional measures in light of the situation in Ukraine and the irreparable harm that may be caused to the country and its citizens in the wake of Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of his neighbouring country.\nAs provisional measures, Ukraine had sought directions to be issued to Russian to immediately suspend all military operations.\na. The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the military operations commenced on 24 February 2022 that have as their stated purpose and objective the prevention and punishment of a claimed genocide in the Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts of Ukraine.\nb.

Russia has a duty not to act to prevent genocide, simply because no genocide exists;\n· Russian forces are targeting civilians in Ukraine; urgent situation requires the passing of provisional measures;\n· Mariupol continues to live without water, electricity and heating as the result of the constant shelling.

The harms already suffered by the Ukrainian people will recur and intensify until Russia has reached its goal, whatever that may be;\n· All three prerequisites for the indication of provisional measures are fulfilled;\n· Whether or not Russia chooses to appear in these proceedings, it should be obligated to follow the measures indicated by the Court;\n· The tragedy being witnessed in the cities of Ukraine was precisely what our modern international legal system was designed to prevent.\nThe Court had said that it would pass an order on the question of provisional measures expeditiously, after hearing lawyers and representatives who made arguments for Ukraine.\nUS-based firm Covington & Burling LLP represented the Ukraine government.

State of Uttarakhand].\nThe bench of Chief Justice of India NV Ramana and Justices AS Bopanna and Hima Kohli held that Section 304B would be attracted in a case where death was caused in suspicious circumstances and it had occurred within 6 months from the date of marriage. \n\"As to the phrase ‘soon before her death’, it is well-settled that the same ought to be interpreted to mean proximate and to be linked with but not to be understood to mean immediately prior to the death. While taking note of the evidence and the other aspects of the matter, what is also to be borne in mind in the instant case is that the death which did not take place in normal circumstances, had occurred within just about 6 months from the date of the marriage,\" the bench opined.\nIn the case, the appellant was married to the deceased-wife on October 20, 2007 and the wife went missing from the matrimonial home on April 24, 2008. The complainant-brother of the deceased alleged that there were multiple demands of dowry by the appellants and the manner in which the appellants behaved with him when he had gone to visit them made him suspect that his sister had been killed by the appellants. \nBased on the complaint, investigation was carried out by the local police and the body of the woman was subsequently found in Ganga river.\nHaving regard to the fact that an unnatural death had taken place within about six months of the marriage and since there was an allegation of cruelty relating to demand of dowry, a case was registered against the appellants (husband, mother-in-law and brother-in-law) for offences under Sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of IPC.\nThe trial court acquitted the appellants but the same was overturned by the Uttarakhand High Court on appeal. \nThey were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and a fine of ₹10,000.\nThis led to the present appeal before the Supreme Court.\nThe apex court laid down the following ingredients which have to be established to prove a case under Section 304A of the Indian Penal Code:\n\"(i) that soon before the death, the deceased was subjected to cruelty and harassment in connection with the demand of dowry;\n(ii) the death of the deceased was caused by any burn or bodily injury or some other circumstance which was not normal;\n(iii) such a death has occurred within 7 years from the date of her marriage; \n(iv) that the victim was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband;\n(v) such a cruelty or harassment should be for, or in connection with the demand of dowry; and\n(vi) it should be established that such cruelty and harassment were made soon before her death.\"\nThe Court said that Section 304B IPC read along with Section 113B of the Indian Evidence Act made it clear that once the prosecution has succeeded in demonstrating that a woman has been subjected to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand for dowry soon after her death, a presumption shall be drawn against the said persons that they have caused dowry death as contemplated under Section 304B IPC. \nThe presumption which is created by Section 113A of the Evidence Act can be rebutted by the accused, if he successfully proves that the aforesaid ingredients of the Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code are not met, the Court added. \nAs regards the phrase 'soon before death' in Section 304B, the Court said that it has to be interpreted to mean proximate and to be linked with death but not to be understood to mean immediately prior to the death.\n\"In the present case, the Court said that the appellants have miserably failed to rebut the presumption drawn against them under Section 113B of the Evidence Act, in a matter relating to an offence under Section 304B of IPC,\" the Court said.\nThe Court, therefore, upheld the conviction of the husband. \nThe apex court, however, partly allowed the appeal and acquitted appellants 2 and 3 (mother-in-law and brother-in-law) because they were residing separately from the house of the victim-wife. Besides, the Court noted that there was no specific role with regard to the demand of dowry and nor has any specific instance of cruelty and harassment been ascribed to the appellants 2 and 3. \nAdvocate Robin R David appeared for the appellants while Advocate Jatinder Kumar Bhatia appeared for the respondent."}

The couple married on May 15, 1982 and had started living separately since 1990s after differences arose between them.\nHowever, since their employer didn't recognise a customary divorce, the husband filed divorce proceedings before a Family Court, which passed an ex-parte order against the wife granting divorce.

Thus the notification of Nov 2021 re-appointing (Dr. Raveendran) as VC of Kannur University is quashed,\" the Supreme Court said.\nThe 2021 re-appointment of Dr. Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University was challenged on the ground that he was past the statutory age-limit of 60 years at the time of his re-appointment since he was 61 at the time of his reappointment (being born on December 19, 1960).\nHis re-appointment was defended on the ground that he was within the age limit when he was appointed for the first time. The said age limit would not apply when it comes to his second appointment, it was argued. \nThe Supreme Court agreed with this submission, holding that the age limit would not apply for \"re-appointments\"\n\"It is not necessary that there cannot be a re-appointment in a tenure post. The outer limit of 61 years will not apply as in the re-appointment process.

The accused along with others allegedly caught Madhu from a nearby forest and assaulted him after accusing him of stealing rice from a grocery shop.\nSixteen persons stood trial for committing offences punishable under Sections 143, 147, 294(b), 323, 324, 326, 342, 352, 364, 367, 368, 302 read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 3(1)(d), 3(1)(r), 3(2)(v), and 3(2)(va) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act (SC/ST Act).\nIn April this year, Hussain and twelve others were convicted by a special court hearing SC/ST Act cases for committing several offenses including under Sections 304 (causing death by negligence) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC.\nThey were sentenced to undergo various periods of imprisonment under each offense, with the longest being seven years imprisonment under Sections 304 and 326.\nSince the sentences were to run concurrently, they would have had to undergo seven years of rigorous imprisonment in total as well as pay the fines as ordered by the trial court.\nOne of the accused was found guilty under Section 352 (punishment for assault or criminal force) of the IPC alone and, therefore, sentenced to 3 months simple imprisonment.\nThe remaining three accused persons were acquitted by the special court.\nSubsequently, all thirteen men who were convicted moved the High Court challenging their conviction and sentence. \nThe State government also filed an appeal against the judgment of the special court, arguing that the thirteen convicts were guilty of more offences than what they were convicted for.\nIt further challenged the finding of the special court with regard to the one convict who was found guilty of only a minor offence.\nThe State also challenged the acquittal of three other accused.\nThe division bench of the High Court stayed the sentence for only the prime accused and granted him bail. \nConsidering the fact that it refused to suspend the sentences imposed on the other twelve accused, the Court acknowledged the need to hear and dispose of the appeals expeditiously.\nIt, therefore, listed the case for hearing on January 15, 2024.\nAdditional Special Public Prosecutor advocate PV Jeevesh appeared for the State."}

The members of the petitioner association shall ensure that levy of service charge in addition and the obligation of customers to pay the same is duly and prominently displayed on the menu or other place where it may be deemed to be expedient. The members of the petitioner associations further undertake not to levy or include service charge on any takeaway orders,\" the order said.\nThe Court sought responses from the respondent and posted the case for hearing next on November 25. \n\"If you don’t want to pay don’t enter the restaurant.

The levying of service charge is displayed at various places in the restaurant. The same is also displayed on the menu cards of the restaurants. Once the customer places the order after being made aware of the terms and conditions there comes into existence a binding contract. No authority can interfere with binding nature of a valid contract until and unless it is shown and proved to be unconscionable or is an unfair trade practice,\" the petition stated.\nPertinently, the plea also cited socio-economic aspects since distribution of service charge collection amongst the employees ensure that the benefit is divided equally among all the staff workers including the utility workers, back end staff etc.\n\"The levying of service charge is a universally accepted trade practice. Service charge is being levied in various countries like UK, Singapore, Japan and USA with varying percentages between 8% and 12.5%,\" the petition said.\nAdvocates Lalit Bhasin, Nina Gupta, Ananya Marwah, Ruchika Joshi and Ajay Pratap Singh appeared for NRAI. \nSenior Advocate Sandeep Sethi along with advocates Sameer Parekh, Sumit Goel and Swati Bhardwaj appeared for the Federation of Hotel and Restaurants Association of India. \nCGSC Sandeep Mahapatra and advocate Varun Kumar Garg appeared for the respondents."}

[Sonu Kumar v Rina Devi]\nThe Hindu Marriage Act does not allow for divorce on the grounds of infertility, a bench of Justice Justice Jitendra Kumar and Justice PB Bajanthri underscored.\nInability to bear a child is a natural aspect of married life, and couples can consider adoption or other alternatives for having children, the bench added.\n\"Inability to bear a child is neither impotence nor any ground for dissolving the marriage. Such possibility of inability to bear a child may be part of marital life of anybody and parties to a marriage may resort to other means for having a child, such as, adoption. Divorce is not provided as per the Hindu Marriage Act in such circumstances,\" the Court said. \nThus, the Court dismissed a man's revision plea challenging the family court's decision which had rejected his divorce petition, filed under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nThe man's plea for divorce was dismissed by the family court, as he failed to substantiate the cruelty allegations against his wife. He had accused her of improper behavior towards his parents and family during her short stay at their matrimonial home.\nAdditionally, it was his argument that she had refused to cohabit and consummate the marriage suggesting her intentions were not to start a family but solely to lose her virginity. He also alleged that she used to have undisclosed meetings with individuals from her village despite objections from family members.\nThe Court was informed that when the wife told her husband about her ill health and requested financial assistance for treatment, he took her to a doctor and based on the doctor's advice, an ultrasonic test was conducted.\nIt revealed that the wife had a cyst in her uterus and no eggs making conception and motherhood unlikely.\nIt was pointed out that the petitioner-husband was 24 years old and in good health and desirous of having a family and becoming a father. However, the respondent-wife is unwilling to cohabit and cannot bear children, it was contended.\nAfter examining the arguments, the Court noted that the divorce petition was filed within two years of marriage, and the wife had lived with the husband for a mere two months. \nThe Court stated that the ground of desertion was not established, as per Section 13(1)(b), which requires desertion to be continuous for a minimum of two years immediately preceding the current petition.\nThe Court further noted that it appeared since wife was having a cyst in her uterus and was unable to bear child, the husband wanted to divorce her and remarry another woman so that he could have a child.\nThe Court did not find any concrete evidence of behavioral misconduct constituting cruelty, except for the wife's purported refusal to live together with the husband.\nThe husband had not initiated any legal action for the restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act, suggesting that his claim of refusal to cohabit was unsubstantiated, the Court noted.\n\"We find that there is no merit in the present appeal warranting any interference in the impugned judgment. The Family Court has rightly dismissed the matrimonial case of the appellant seeking divorce. \nHence, the Court dismissed the husband's appeal.\nAdvocate Shyam Sunder Pandey represented Sonu Kumar."}

Such a decision lies within the ambit of policy making powers of the government. We do not find any constitutional infirmity on the OROP principle and the notification dated November 7, 2015,\" the Court said.\nThe OROP definition as argued by the petitioner is not found to be arbitrary by this Court, the Bench added.\nThe Court, however, said that a refixation exercise must be conducted by the government for a period of 5 years with regard to pension payable to Army personnel as stated in the OROP policy in accordance with the November 7, 2015 notification. \n\"Refixation exercise to be carried out from July 1, 2019. And arrears to be paid to Army personnel within 3 months,\" the Bench ordered.\nThe top court was hearing a petition filed by Indian Ex-Servicemen Movement seeking implementation of the scheme in the Defense Forces as was envisaged in 2014 by the then Finance Minister, P Chidambaram.\nThe plea has claimed that despite the assurance on the floor of the parliament in 2014 by the Finance Minister, what was being implemented was \"different amount of pension for personnel on same rank depending on when the person has retired\".\nNotably, in his budgetary speech, the Finance Minister had endorsed the recommendation of the Koshiyari Committee of 2011 that had recommended for grant of One Rank One Pension i.e. uniform pension is to be paid to the Personnel of Armed Forces who retire on the same rank with the same length of service, irrespective of their date of retirement and any future enhancement in the rates of pension will be automatically passed on to the past pensioners.\nFiled through Advocate-on-Record Balaji Srinivasan, the plea questioned the Central government's notification dated November 7, 2015. \nThe plea stated that the Central government under the guise of implementing OROP, twisted or modified or altered the definition of OROP as being uniform payment of pension to retired servicemen retiring in the same rank with the same length of service, regardless of their date of retirement, meaning thereby that the gap between the rates of pension of current and past pensioners were to be bridged at \"periodic intervals\".\n\"Government Notification of November 7, 2015 goes to the very heart and soul of the OROP and alters it, as the OROP involves enhancement in the rates of pension being passed on to passed pensioners and OROP is not merely about pension but about 'justice, equity, izzat and status',\" the plea stated.\nThe plea sought annual revision of pension under OROP and for calculating pension based on 2014 salary of ex-servicemen which with regard to the 2015 notification was being fixed on the basis of 2013 and the periodic review was fixed at 5 years.\nSenior Advocate Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for the petitioners had argued that the 2015 notification is arbitrary on the face of it since it introduces certain elements of inequality in terms of grant of pension and is in direct contradiction to the assurance given in the Finance Minister's Budgetary speech of 2014 and to the recommendations of Koshiyari Committee.\n\"You cannot introduce the devil in details. Now you are putting riders,\" Senior Advocate Ahmadi had stated regarding the 2015 notification drawing a new definition of the OROP Scheme.\nIn response to the same, the Central government had argued that the speech by the Finance Minister wherein the Koshiyari Committee's recommendations of 2011 for OROP was endorsed was not based on any decision reached by the Union Cabinet.\nIn its affidavit before the Supreme Court, the Central government had in certain terms stated that both 'same rank' and 'same length of service' in defense services are necessary conditions for claiming One Rank One Pension benefits.\nMoreover, the Central government while objecting to the stand of the petitioners that while grant of pensionary benefit under OROP, emphasis should be laid on the rank of the personnel and not on the length of the service, states that the same is impermissible and unsustainable in law.\n\"The contention of the Petitioners defeats one of the core values of the OROP, which is not only same rank but with the same length of service. This pair cannot be impaired. One cannot take only the same rank and ignore the length of service and similarly one cannot merely take the length of service and ignore the rank. The core parameter is same rank and same length of service. It is important to highlight that the expression \"same\" appears twice as \"same rank\" and \"same length of service\". By any stretch of imagination, it cannot be read as same rank different length of service or same length of service different ranks. It precisely meets with the Constitutional test under Article 14 which is 'unequal should not be treated equally' and 'equals should not be treated to be unequally',\" the Centre had submitted.\nThe Central government had also made it clear before the Court that for the purpose of computation of OROP benefits, it has taken Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) as the base, and has applied it across the board for all the retirees having the same length of service.\nAdditional Solicitor General (ASG) N Venkataraman appearing for the Centre had stated that there has been no discrimination of any of the retirees in any form whatsoever.\n\"Heart of the policy maker is as wide as citizen but when we work on the table and ultimately arrive at the policy, concerns are always baring,\" the ASG had argued.\nWith regard to the argument of the petitioners questioning the November 7, 2015 notification that the same has modified or altered the definition of OROP, the Central government had submitted that the official documents with regard to OROP do not support such a construction.\nAdditionally, with regard to petitioners emphasizing on the expression, 'automatic' for revising OROP automatically rather than once in 5 years, the Centre had submitted that:\n\"It is surprising the expression \"automatically\" is perceived and contended as something which is with reference to time or period. The expression \"automatically\" follows the expression \"in the rates of pension to be automatically passed on to the past pensioners\" The expression \"automatically\" should be read contextually meaning the rates of pension will be passed on to the past pensioners without any difficulties or impediments in terms of sanctions and other procedural interventions. It is surprising that the Petitioners read it as period and time. The above statement does not convey even remotely any committed manner of computation including periods and time. Therefore, this out of context reference needs to be rejected. More importantly, the policy document states that OROP is to bridge the gap between the rates of pension of current and past pensioners, which objective has been duly complied with.\"\nThe top court had reserved its judgment in the matter on February 23."}

The relief to a party cannot be denied because there was no deliberate or willful ill-treatment,\" the Court underlined.  \nThe Court, therefore, upheld a judgment of a family court in Shimla which had on August 14, 2019 granted divorce to the husband on grounds of cruelty. \n\"Needless to say, matrimonial matters are matters of delicate human and emotional relationship and to maintain such relationship for a long, there is requirement of mutual trust, regard, respect, love and affection. Since in the case at hand, the wife made serious and scandalous allegations regarding adulterous life of her husband, the court below, rightly arrived at a conclusion that false allegation of adultery constitutes mental cruelty,\" the bench said in its December 18 judgment. \nIt further emphasised that levelling such allegations of adultery and failing to prove the same harms a person's reputation. \n\"Levelling disgusting accusations of indecent familiarity with a person outside wedlock and allegations of extra marital relationship constitutes grave assault on the character, honour, reputation and status of the spouse. Definitely, such aspersions amount to worst form of insult and cruelty, which itself is sufficient to substantiate cruelty in law,\" the Court underscored.  \nThe Court passed the order while dismissing an appeal filed by a wife who claimed that her husband had subjected her to cruelty by ill-treating her. \nOn the other hand, the husband claimed that the wife doubted his character and linked him with one lady from his office. He contended that his entire family was aware about this woman in his office but now they weren't on talking terms. The husband cited an incident wherein the wife had visited his office and created a scene there. \nThe husband further stated that within seven months of the wife giving birth to a daughter, she left him and took up a government job against the family's wishes and even left the child with her in-laws. \nThe wife's workplace was around 50 km away from their residence and thus, she started living separately, the husband highlighted. \nThe Court observed that the word \"cruelty\" has not been defined despite it being used in the Hindu Marriage Act in the context of human conduct in relation to or in respect of matrimonial duties or obligations. \n\"It is a course of conduct of one which adversely affects the other. Cruelty can be mental, physical, intentional or unintentional,\" the bench said. \nIt further explained that in case of physical cruelty, courts have to ascertain the question of fact and also the degree of the same. However, in instances of mental cruelty, courts must look into the nature of the alleged cruel treatment and the impact of such conduct on the spouse.\n\"There may be cases where the conduct complained of itself if bad enough and per se unlawful and illegal. Then, the impact of the injurious effect on the other spouse need not be enquired into. In such like cases, the cruelty will be established if the conduct itself it proved or admitted,\" the bench said. \nIn the present case, the bench opined that the wife failed to prove the allegations that she levelled against her husband, whereas the husband proved his contentions against the wife. \nAs regards the issue of taking up a government job, the Court said the issue was \"debatable.\"\n\"Though this court is persuaded to agree with the wife that she being educated lady is entitled to do job and qua such fact, no objection could have every been raised by the family members including the husband but whether government job could have been taken by the wife at the distance of 50 kms to 60 kms from their native place, that too leaving her seven months daughter is a debatable question,\" the Court said while upholding the family court verdict. \nSenior Advocate Ajay Kochhar along with Advocates Vivek Sharma and Anubhav Chopra appeared for the Wife. \nSenior Advocate GC Gupta and advocate Meera Devi represented the Husband."}

The judge concluded that the injury was caused before her death, based on testimonies by two medical experts.\nShe was killed after she witnessed Father Thomas Kottoor, Sister Sephy and possibly the second accused in a compromising position, the Court concluded. Having witnessed this, she was hit on the head with a 'hand axe' (that caused the head injury) and thrown into a well to cover up the cause of her death, Justice Sanilkumar additionally noted.\nThere was no possibility of Sister Abhaya committing suicide, as was alleged by defence\nWitnesses examined by the Court, who interacted with Abhaya in the days and weeks preceding her death found her to have been cheerful and eager to pursue her studies.\nInterestingly, the Court even adverted to the testimony of two other inmates of Sister Abhaya’s convent, who were staunch upholders of the suicide theory.\nThey deposed that they had made plans with Sister Abhaya for a group study session in the morning on the date of her decease.\nThe Court remarked:\n“A person bent on ending her life, and ending it in the immediate future at that, would not worry about her academic prospects, would not deny herself sleep for the sake of improving her examination...performance, and would not devote herself passionately to study, much less engage herself in combined study with her fellow students. This single fact is sufficient to blow the suicide theory sky high.\"\nConcluding that Abhaya was \"smart, pious, honest, simple, perseverant and punctilious girl, meticulous in all aspects, leading an altruistic life\" the Court remarked that it was \"simply impossible for her to have ended her life on her own as portrayed by the defence\".\nSighting Father Thomas Kottoor in the precincts of the convent – the testimony of Adakku Raju \nAdakku Raju, or Andassu (decent) Raju, as he has been affectionately called by many, was a petty thief who used to steal the copper plates from the lightning arresters on the terrace of the convent. The Judge noted that Raju steadfastly stood by his testimony that he had seen Father Thomas Kottoor and another man on the terrace of the hostel standing with torches.\nWhereas the defence sought to question the credibility of Raju’s testimony on account of his antecedents, the Court noted that he stood his ground, in the face of “continuous, severe and grueling cross-examination by two lawyers for two long days…”\nThe order referred to how Raju faced threats, torture, and grants of huge sums of money to give up on his testimony and confess to Sister Abhaya’s murder, which he withstood.\nSister Sephy’s conduct\nThe Court recorded that Sister Sephy was alone during the night of Sister Abhaya’s death, as her roommate had gone to a retreat center. There were unusual disturbances in the kitchen at night as well as in the morning, which the court culled from the testimony of other inmates in the convent, who later turned hostile.\nSister Sephy’s hymenoplasty\nA key finding was that Sister Sephy had undergone a gynaecological procedure to cover up the fact that she had engaged in sexual intercourse. The Court noted that the procedure was done “on the eve” of her arrest by the CBI.\nFather Thomas Kottoor’s statement\nCrucially, the Court took note of a statement made by Father Kottoor to one of the witnesses, Kalarcode Venugopalan, who had contacted Kottoor after he found out that Kottoor might be required to undergo a narcoanalysis\nHe had emotionally admitted to Venugopal that he was not made of iron and stone but was a human being who had lived at one point with Sister Sephy as husband and wife…and why was he being crucified?\nThe defence sought to discredit the witness’ testimony. The Court stated that the demeanour of the accused, his gestures throughout his testimony, as well as the fact that he did not diverge from the basic facts of his testimony stood witness to his reliability.\nOrganized efforts by the powers that be to subvert the prosecution case\nThe Court noted that the inmates of the convent had suddenly turned hostile en masse “without rhyme or reason”, evidence found missing, and that the convent cook Achamma had even filed a case before the Supreme Court challenging the legal validity of narco analysis. The Court observed that she had admitted to the fact that Senior Advocate Harish Salve,\"arguably India's greatest living lawyer\" was her counsel before the apex court. She conceded that her litigation had been financed by the convent and that she was not aware of its nitty-gritty, the judgment said. \nThis proved, according to the Court \"a systematic, organized effort was exerted sub rosa by the powers that be to subvert the prosecution case and prevent it from reaching its logical conclusion.”\nJudge Sanilkumar also came down strongly on the officers investigating the case, Deputy Superintendent of Police K Samuel and the then Superintendent of Police KT Michael whose “strange interest” in the case led to the destruction of evidence, the concocting of evidence and the influencing of witnesses, as well as torturing Adacku Raju. \nThe Court gave stern warning against such kind of interference in the future, ordering that a copy of its judgment be served on the State Police Head.\nOn these, as well as an elaborate examination of other facts proved, the Court closed the contentious case."}

However, the accused had been absconding since then and did not cooperate with the probe, the Court was told. \nThe judge opined that the custodial interrogation of the accused was required in the case. \nThe Court reasoned further that when serious offences are disclosed and the involvement of an accused is prima facie established, the Courts should be slow to grant anticipatory bail. \nIn this case, the Court found that prima facie, the accused had played an active role in the alleged crime, which was executed in a very planned and methodical manner. The judge commented that it was not only an offence against an individual but that it affected larger societal interests. \nThe object of anticipatory bail, the bench went on to point out, is that a person should not be harassed or humiliated in order to satisfy the grudge or personal vendetta of a complainant. \n\"However, in the present case, no any such sort of allegation or bias is found out.

Certainly the answer would be in negative,” the Bench added.\nWith this, the tenets governing guardianship under Mohammedan Law were examined by the High Court. The Bench took note that the mother was entitled to custody of her male child until he completes the age of 7 years and her female child until she attains the age of puberty i.e., 14 years.\nDespite this, the Court remained aware of the well-established principles that the welfare of the minor must be taken into consideration while appointing a guardian.\nThe judgment of the Supreme Court in Mousami Moitra Ganguli v Jayanti Ganguli was relied on by the Division Bench, where the Supreme Court had expressed the view that while deciding an issue as to which parent the care and control of a child should be committed, the first and paramount consideration should be the welfare and interest of the child and not the rights of the parents under a statute.\nConsidering the statements made by the children in the present case, the view taken was that their answers were logical and thus, it appeared that they were old enough to form an intelligent preference to be in the custody of the mother.\n“The custody battle of children requires a human touch apart from the statutory obligation, therefore, we are of the view that the children's wish and will would prevail over,” the judgment said.\nThe Court, therefore, held that the order of the Family Court did not require interference and the custody of the children should continue with the mother.\nThe Court, however, also protected the interests of the father by laying down detailed guidelines for visitation rights while emphasising on the importance of the bond to be maintained between the father and the children.\n“It held that the communication will help in maintaining and improving the bond between the children and the parent who is denied the custody.

Act but has at any point of time lived so or had the right to live and has been subjected to domestic violence or is later subjected to domestic violence on account of the domestic relationship, is entitled to file an application under Section 12 of the D.V. Act\", the Court said in its judgment.\nThe judgment thus underscored that to determine a domestic relationship between the parties, courts should not only consider the subsisting relationships in present, but also past domestic relationships.\nThe judgment was passed on an appeal moved by a woman who had filed an application under Section 12 of the Domestic Violence Act after the death of her husband, against her mother-in-law and father-in-law, seeking residence order to reside in the property of her late husband, return of stridhan etc.\nA Magistrate had partly allowed the application and ordered that the appellant and her child shall not be restricted from enjoying the property of her deceased husband. The Domestic Incident Report (report) by the Protection Officer was not sought by the appellant and the same was not filed before the Magistrate.\nOn an appeal moved by the respondent, the order of the Magistrate was reversed by the Sessions Court primarily on the ground that the appellant had never lived with the respondents and that she used to live in a different city with her husband. \nThe Sessions Court order was later upheld by the Uttarakhand High Court prompting the instant appeal before the Supreme Court.\nThe top court was posed with the following three questions raised by counsel for the appellant and Amicus Curie, Advocate Gaurav Aggarwal: \nwhether it is mandatory to file a report to invoke the relief under the Domestic Violence Act;\nwhether it is mandatory for the aggrieved person to reside with the persons against whom the relief is claimed; and\nwhether there should be a subsisting domestic relationship between the aggrieved person and persons against whom the relief is claimed. \nThe top court answered the first question in negative, ruling that Section 12 of the Act does not make it mandatory for the Magistrate to consider the reports filed by protection officer or service provider, and an order can be passed by the Magistrate even if there is no report on record.\nThe objective and purpose of the act shall be defeated if the magistrate is mandated to consider the report, in spite of an application or complaint by the aggrieved person, the judgment noted. \nThe apex court answered the second question in the negative as well and held that it is not mandatory for the aggrieved person to actually reside with the persons against whom the relief is claimed at the time of commission of domestic violence. \nAn aggrieved person can be in a domestic relationship with the perpetrators and Section 17(1) of the Act confers a right to every woman to reside in a shared household , if she is in a domestic relationship, irrespective of the fact whether she is aggrieved under the Act or not, the Court held. \nWhen the woman is restricted from her right to reside in the shared household, then she can file an application under Section 12 of the Act. \n\"It is held that it is not mandatory for the aggrieved person to have actually lived or resided with those persons against whom the allegations have been levelled at the time of seeking relief. If a woman has the right to reside in a shared household, she can accordingly enforce her right under Section 17(1) of the DV Act,\" the bench ruled.\nAnswering the third question, the top court observed that the term \"domestic relationship\" is of wide amplitude and must be so in the Indian context. \nThe Bench stated that domestic relationships would include family members living together when they are related by consanguinity, marriage or adoption and also those persons who are living together or jointly as a joint family such as foster children who live with other members who are related by consanguinity, marriage or by adoption.\n\"In the Indian societal context, the right of a woman to reside in the shared household is of unique importance. The reasons for the same are not far to see. In India, most women are not educated nor are they earning; neither do they have financial independence so as to live singly. She may be dependent for residence in a domestic relationship not only for emotional support but for the aforesaid reasons,\" the Court observed.\nThe definition of domestic relationship was widened by the Supreme Court adhering to the objectives and reasons of the Act.\nWhile considering the societal realities, the top court further held that the term 'joint family' cannot mean joint family as under the Hindu Law and its interpretation has to be wider.\n\"Therefore, the expression ‘joint family’ cannot mean as understood in Hindu Law. Thus, the expression ‘family members living together as a joint family’, means the members living jointly as a family.

[OBC Advocate Welfare Association v. High Court of Madhya Pradesh] \nThe High Court's decision to introduce the scheme had prompted lawyers to go on strike in March this year, with the State Bar Council members even meeting the Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud. That meeting ended with the CJI assuring the lawyers of redressal of their concerns and requesting them to call off their strike.\nHowever, the OBC Advocate Welfare Association and Advocate Union for Democracy and Social Justice challenged the scheme before the High Court, arguing that except the legislature, nobody can prescribe any time limit to decide cases. \nA Bench of Justice Vivek Agarwal and Justice Avanindra Kumar Singh said that the aim of the scheme framed by the High Court was to provide speedy justice to litigants.\nThe scheme strikes the right balance between administrative efficiency and the legal protection of the rights of the citizens, the Court held.\n\"Scheme is to make the judicial officers answerable and accountable. Their hardships have been taken into consideration and, therefore, three provisions have been introduced, namely, that of carry forward by one quarter, not including the cases in which there is stay by a superior court in the list of 25 oldest cases and thirdly, factoring in the time which is spent by a Judge in holding a Link Court, etc. for which principle of proportionality has been applied,\" the judgment stated.\nThe '25 debt scheme' called for a list of 25 cases for each quarter be prepared and a consolidated list of 100 cases for a year be sent to the Registry of the High Court. Undisposed cases out of the oldest 25 cases by the end of the year 2022 would be carried forward to the first quarter of the year 2023, which will be in addition to the 25 oldest cases of first quarter of 2023.\nCases of the first quarter could be carried forward to the next quarter in case the disposal of 25 cases in the first quarter was not possible for various reasons.\nThe Court opined that the scheme was aimed towards those litigants who were standing in the queue with no clue of the existence of any light at the end of the tunnel. \n“If he is given a hope, a dream that even he could get his justice quickly then the application of scheme which fulfills the aspirations of a common litigant, cannot be snatched away in the name of personal inconveniences to the body of Advocates who have failed to bring on record any empirical data to support their case.\"\nObserving that the petitioners had failed to show how the scheme prejudiced the lawyer community or litigants, the Court said that expecting more efficiency in the system and taking measures to achieve the same cannot be said to be violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.\nThe Court went on to observe that petitions had been filed in utter haste without undertaking any empirical study.\nOn delays in the court system, the Court noted,\n“Studies which have been undertaken to understand the underlying reasons for delay apart from undefined huge pendency on account of poor Judge-Population ratio and inadequate infrastructure, also takes into consideration that due to independence of judiciary, some Judges think that they are not accountable to anyone due to which many a times they are drived towards comfort, etc. resulting in delay in the system.”\nThe Court further said that nobody can be allowed to escape from the net of the system merely on account of delay and laches. Merely prescribing a roster for disposal of 25 oldest cases was not violative of fundamental rights, it added.\nIt also highlighted that the scheme was introduced in 2022 and there was no challenge to the original scheme. \nIn conclusion, the Court said with passage of time, the High Court has improvised the scheme after taking into consideration realities as have emerged from time to time.\n“Thus, it is not the case of the petitioner that High Court has failed to take into consideration, difficulties of the judicial officers or the Advocates and on that ground also, petitions deserve to be and are hereby dismissed,” it added.\nAdvocate Rameshwar Singh Thakur represented the petitioners.\nDeputy Advocate General Ashish Anand Bernard represented the State."}

However, the Court observed that it had nowhere been argued that the husband and wife were living in separate rooms or had strained relationships.\n“The recovery was also not from a person but from a joint space and hence, to state that the recovery of 1.03 kgs made from the bedroom cannot be attributable to the Applicant would be a wrong assertion,” it added.\nThe Court also observed that since both the husband and wife are admittedly consumers of narcotic substances and as the couple share a special relationship, it can be inferred that both were aware of the contraband in their bedroom at their residence and were in conscious possession of the same.\n“I am unable to agree with the argument put forth by the learned counsel for the applicant. The recovery of ganja from the bedroom (i.e. residential premises) of the applicant is attributable to both, the applicant and the husband/co-accused, Krunal Golwala,” the Court said.\nHowever, since the ganja recovered in the case fell under intermediate quantity, the Court said the stringent bail conditions under Section 37 of the NDPS Act will not be applicable.\nWith respect to the recovery of commercial quantity at her husband’s office, the Court said the same is separated by a staircase as the husband and wife have their offices on separate floors. Accordingly, it opined that the office premises is not a shared space of the couple and the recovery from there cannot be attributed to the wife.\nOn the mobile chats of the woman, the Court said she has a potential to deal in commercial quantity but “potential” alone would not come within the purview of Section 37 of NDPS Act.\n“In my view, as of today, the chats show that the Applicant is a small-time consumer, sharing hash and weed with two people,” the Court said.\nWhether she is a drug-dealer or not can only be ascertained during the trial, the Court added.\nConsidering the fact that the woman is not a flight risk and there is no apprehension of tampering with evidence or influencing witnesses, the Court granted bail to her.\nAdvocates Faraz Maqbool, Vismita Diwan and Sana Juneja represented Dixita Golwala.\nSenior Standing Counsel Subhash Bansal with Advocate Raghav Bansal appeared for the Narcotics Control Bureau"}

The deceased’s heir (appellant) was not paid compensation and she approached the Commissioner Workmen’s Compensation, Beed and claimed ₹5 lakh. \nHer claim was allowed and the Commissioner directed the respondents jointly and severally to pay compensation along with simple interest at 12 percent per annum from the date of the accident. \nFurther, the Commissioner imposed a penalty of 50 percent on the compensation amount as per Section 4A(3)(b) of of the Act.\nDissatisfied with the order of the Commissioner, the respondents approached the Bombay High Court. \nThe High Court dismissed the appeal, but set aside the penalty and modified the interest awarded, to be made payable from a month after expiry of the Commissioner's order instead of date of accident.\nAggrieved by the order, heir of the deceased approached the Supreme Court.\nThe apex court held that as per Section 4A(1) of the Act, the liability to pay the compensation would arise immediately on the death of the deceased.\nThe interest would, therefore, be payable from the date of death of deceased. \nThe Court also sought to distinguish between interest and penalty payable under the Act.\n\"The provision for levy of interest would be under Section 4A(3)(a) and the provision for levy of penalty would be under Section 4A(3)(b),\" the Court noted.\nIt said that the High Court while directing the employer to pay the interest from the date of the order passed by the Commissioner, has not at all considered Section 4A(3)(a) and has considered Section 4A(3)(b) only, which is the penalty provision.\nIn view of the above, the Supreme Court set aside the High Court judgment and directed that interest on compensation be paid from the date of death of the deceased. \nAdvocates Shivaji M Jadhav and Qurratulain appeared for the appellant. \nAdvocates Samrat Krishnarao Shinde and Sarang Aaradhya represented the respondents."}

Therefore, given the exceptional circumstance, the need for prior permission could be dispensed with.

It has repeatedly been emphasized by the Supreme Court that the Courts and Judges must make a dispassionate assessment of evidence and that the Courts and Judges should not be swayed by the horror of crime and the character of the person,\" the High Court said.\nA judge, while discharging judicial duties, should not be influenced by his own imagined norms of the functioning of the society, the Court added.\n\"The Trial Court ought to have avoided the sweeping and disparaging remarks made in para 42 of its judgment regarding the conduct of the appellants,” the High Court said. \nIn the present case, there was no direct evidence against the accused-appellant for the murder of the deceased and the conviction was based purely on circumstantial evidence which did not point towards commission of the crime alleged, the Court said. \nThe case against the accused was for killing his wife because of non-fulfillment of dowry demands. \nFIR was registered by the father of the deceased who alleged that the appellant and his family subjected the deceased to cruelty. He claimed that she was killed by administration of poison in her food because of non-fulfilment of dowry demands and she was buried without informing him or his family.\nThe Sessions Judge, Gopalgunj convicted the husband and other appellants for the offences of cruelty, causing dowry death, murder and causing disappearance of evidence (Sections 498-A, 304-B, 302 and 201/34 of the Indian Penal Code.) \nThe accused-husband was sentenced to death for the offence under Section 302, and the same was referred to the High Court for confirmation.\nThe counsel for the appellants submitted that, “when two views are possible on the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other to his innocence, the benefit of doubt should be given to the accused.”\nAfter analysing the trial court judgement at length and considering the rival arguments and the submissions of Amicus Curiae, the Court made observations on basic rules to be followed by a judge while writing a judgement. \nThe supreme requirement of a judgment is reason, which is the rational to the conclusion, the Court said. \n\"Reasoning is the mental process through which a Judge reaches to his conclusion. All conclusions should be supported by reasons duly recorded. The finding of fact should be based on legal testimony and should be based on legal grounds. Neither the finding of fact nor the decision should be based upon wild suspicion, hypothetical presumption, surmises and conjectures,\" the Court said. \nFurther, while commenting on the conduct of the parties, a judge is required to be careful to use sober and restrained language, the Court opined. \n\"He should avoid use of disparaging and derogatory remarks against any person whose case may be under consideration before him,” the judgment said. \nFurther, a court while writing judgment should be dispassionate in assessing the evidence, the Court said. \nIn the present case, the Court found that there was a complete lack of direct evidence against the appellants for the murder of the deceased, and the conviction was based purely on circumstantial evidence. \n“Undoubtedly, the conviction can be based solely on circumstantial evidence, but it should be tested on the touchstone of the law relating to proof beyond reasonable doubt.”\nIn the instant case, the Court said that there was no such evidence against the appellants. \n\"On the contrary, the evidence is that when the deceased was found unwell, she was taken to Sadar Hospital, Gopalganj for treatment. She was administered fluid and was provided treatment at Sadar Hospital.

There is also evidence that the family members of the deceased were present at the time of burial.

They can read the judgment and criticize the judgment if they want and of course not the judges who wrote the judgment. ...If the lawyers started to comment about a judgment without reading a judgment, nobody can blame the poor citizens who make comments about judgment and judges on social media,\" the Court said in its order.\nThe Judge noted that most of the criticism against the movie seemed to come from persons who had not watched the movie in its entirety, when he made the allegory to lawyers criticising judgments of the Court without reading the same in its entirety.\n\"Similarly when a Court delivers a judgment in a case, even before the judgment reaches the public, the criticism starts. It is surprising to see that, few lawyers are making comments about judgments of court of law even without reading the judgments.

In this regard, reliance was placed on Rules 2(xxiii) and 12 of the Bar Council of India – Rules of Legal Education, 2008\nHowever, the principals of the respective colleges took the stand they will permit the applicants to attend the classes online if the Court passes an order to that effect.\nThe High Court after referring to various precedents and international treaties observed that education is the most potent mechanism for the advancement of an individual.\nRegarding the UGC Regulations, the Court said that prohibition on online classes in the said Regulations is a general one which operates against institutions to prevent it from providing LL.B Courses under online mode.\nIt cannot be seen as prohibiting a student from attending the course through online mode in peculiar circumstances, the Court ruled.\n\"Permitting a particular student to attend the course online in exceptional cases like the present would not in our opinion violate the above Regulation,\" the order said.\nSince the appellants are confined to jail, they are unable to attend the course physically and hence, their presence through online mode can be treated as equivalent to attending the course in regular offline mode, the Court said. \nTherefore, the High Court permitted both the life convicts to attend classes through online mode.\n\"The applicants can also be permitted to be physically present at the college whenever their physical presence is necessary and indispensable for practical training or attending examinations,\" the Court added.\nIt, therefore, directed the jail superintendents of both jails and the principals of both colleges to make necessary arrangement to enable the two convicts to attend classes online.\n\"Whenever the physical presence of the applicants is insisted by the college/university for attending moot court, seminar, workshop, internship programme, examination or any other practical training, the Jail Superintendent is directed to release them on interim bail for the required period on executing a bond for ₹1 lakh with two solvent sureties. The applicants shall file an application to that effect before the jail superintendent with supporting document from the college/university,\" the Court further directed.\nAdvocate Nandagopal S Kurup appeared for the convict while advocate EC Bineesh represented the State."}

Satish)\nA Bench of Justices UU Lalit, S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi held that the ingredient of the offence of 'sexual assault' under POCSO is sexual intent and skin to skin contact in such incidents is not relevant.\nThe law has to be given an interpretation that gives effect to the intention of legislature instead of defeating it, the Court underscored.\n\"The most important ingredient of for constituting the offence of sexual assault is sexual intent and not skin to skin contact with the child. Construction of a rule should give effect to rule rather than destroying it. The intention of legislature cannot be given effect to unless wider interpretation is given,\" the Court said.\nMandating \"skin to skin\" contact for making out the offence of sexual assault would amount to a narrow and absurd interpretation, the Court added.\nHence, the Court ruled that any act of touching any sexual part of a child with sexual intent cannot be taken away from the purview of Section 7 of the POCSO Act.\n\"Whoever, with sexual intent touches the vagina, penis, anus or breast of the child or makes the child touch the vagina, penis, anus or breast of such person or any other person, would be committing an offence of 'sexual assault'. Similarly, whoever does any other act with sexual intent which involves physical contact without penetration, would also be committing the offence of “sexual assault” under Section 7 of the POCSO Act,\" the judgment stated.\nJustice Ravindra Bhat delivered a separate concurring judgment.\nThe Bombay High Court had on January 19 ruled that pressing the breast of a 12-year-old child without removing her clothes will only fall within the definition of outraging the modesty of a woman under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and not sexual assault under the POCSO.\nIt had, therefore, acquitted a man for an offence under Section 7 of POCSO on the ground that the victim was clothed and there was no “skin-to-skin” contact.\n\"The act of pressing of breast of the child aged 12 years, in the absence of any specific detail as to whether the top was removed or whether he inserted his hand inside top and pressed her breast, would not fall in the definition of ‘sexual assault’. It would certainly fall within the definition of the offence under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code,\" the High Court had ruled. \nJustice Pushpa V Ganediwala of the High Court, had therefore, acquitted the accused under Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the POCSO Act. The Court, however, maintained his conviction under Sections 354 (assault of criminal force) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC, considering the act which he committed amounted to use of criminal force to outrage her modesty.\nWhereas the punishment for sexual assault under Section 8 of the POCSO Act is imprisonment of 3-5 years, the punishment under Section 354 of IPC is imprisonment of 1-5 years.\nThe apex court had stayed the controversial judgment on January 27 this year, after Attorney General KK Venugopal mentioned the matter suo motu and termed it as a \"very disturbing conclusion.\"\nSubsequently, appeals challenging the judgment were filed by the State of Maharashtra, and the National Commission for Women (NCW).\nThe top court had reserved its judgment in the matter on September 30.\nIn its judgment today, the Court said that when the legislature has expressed clear intention with regard to a law, courts cannot create ambiguity with respect to it.\n\"Purpose of the law cannot be to allow the offender to escape the meshes of the law,\" the Court said.\nThe Court while setting aside the High Court verdict ordered that the accused has to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and simple imprisonment for one month.\nOn a different note the Supreme Court noted that \"surprisingly\" the Registry of High Court of Bombay, Nagpur Bench, has certified the copy of the High Court judgment by affixing the stamp on the back side of every page of the judgment which is blank. \n\"The said copy of the judgment appears to have been downloaded from the website and, therefore, does not bear even the signature or the name of the concerned judge at the end of the judgment,\" the top court noted.\nSuch a practice may allow the miscreants to manipulate or commit mischief in the judicial orders which are used as the public documents having great significance in the judicial proceedings, the Bench said.\nThe Court, therefore, directed the Registrar General of the Bombay High Court to look into the matter and ensure that proper procedure for preparing the certified copies of the judgments/orders of the Court in accordance with law is followed."}

[Yes Bank Ltd vs Union of India and Ors.]\nJustices GS Kulkarni and Rajesh S Patil observed that Rule 5(1) of the 2013 Rules, which provided for the refund of court fees, could not be interpreted to defeat any entitlement of the applicant for refund permitted under Rule 4.\nThe Court explained that merely because the defendant or the opposing party was not giving consent for a joint application to be filed for a refund, the legal right of the applicant to receive the refund cannot be defeated.\n\"We are of the clear opinion that Rule 5(1) providing for refund of court fees cannot be read so as to defeat and/or frustrate any entitlement of the applicant for refund of Court fees as may be permissible under the provisions of Rule 4 as noted above. Merely because the defendant is not coming forward or is not available or he does not intend or is not agreeable for giving his consent for a joint application to be presented for refund of court fees, cannot defeat the legal rights of the applicant like the Petitioner to receive the Court fees,\" the Court's order stated.\nThe Court was hearing a writ petition by Yes Bank Ltd., which had sought the deletion of the words “and Defendant shall file joint Application” from Rule 5 of the Debts and Recovery Tribunal (Refund of Court fees) Rules. \nThe bank also urged the High Court to direct the concerned DRT Registrar to immediately release an amount due as a refund to the bank, which had been quantified in a DRT order, without insisting on a joint application.\nBy way of background, a borrower had defaulted in the repayment of a bank loan, prompting the bank to file recovery proceedings before a DRT in Mumbai.\nHowever, since the parties arrived at an out-of-court settlement, the bank withdrew the proceedings. It was then directed to follow the procedure for refund of court fees as per the relevant rules.\nThe bank then filed an application for a refund of court fees. The DRT, on June 18, 2022, passed an order on this application, observing that the applicant and the defendant should file a joint application for the refund of court fees as per the rules.\nAggrieved by this move, the bank approached the High Court. It told the Court that when the recovery proceedings were filed, it had paid full court fees of ₹1,50,000.\nThe bank highlighted that there were several recovery cases where borrowers agree to pay the outstanding amounts or opt for out-of-court settlements. It is difficult for the bank to obtain their consent on a joint application for a court refund in all such cases, the bank contended.\nThus, it argued that the requirement of filing a joint application causes immense prejudice to the bank. Therefore, the bank prayed for a direction to the DRT to issue the refund of court fees without insisting on a joint refund application.\nThe respondents, which included Central government authorities and the DRT-II at Mumbai, countered that the bank's plea should be dismissed because it had not demonstrated any injustice done to it. \nThey added that if there is a settlement between the borrower and the bank, all dues, including legal expenses and court fees incurred by the bank, can be part of such settlement. \nThey further argued that in order to prevent the bank from receiving dual benefits from both the borrower and the Tribunal, Rule 5(1) of the Rules requires the filing of a joint application by the applicant and the defendant in order to obtain a court fee refund. \nResultantly, they contended that the provision protects the interests of both the bank and the borrower. They further claimed that refunding court fees to the petitioner-bank may lead to unjust enrichment.\nThe Court noted that in many recovery matters, financial institutions settle for an amount that is lesser than the outstanding dues. \nFurther, it observed that in many cases, immediately after the filing of recovery proceedings, borrowers may settle the disputes but not contact the bank thereafter for a number of reasons. It also highlighted that even in suits before a civil court, on settlement, the court fees are refunded only to the plaintiff.\nThe Court observed that it is fully and completely within the domain of the applicant whether it should pursue recovery proceedings or to withdraw the same in view of any settlement reached with the defendant.\nEven the tribunal would not have a second thought if the applicant withdrew the proceedings, the Court remarked, going on to hold that, as a natural consequence, the applicant would be entitled to a refund of court fees. \nThe Court opined that the insistence on a joint application in such a case would be contrary to the order passed by the DRT permitting the withdrawal of the recovery application and granting an order of refund.\nHence, it read down 2013 Rules to mean that once the DRT itself allows a refund of court fees to the applicant, and when the entitlement to a refund of the fees has been fixed by a judicial order, it would not be permissible for the Registrar of the DRT to insist that a joint application ought to be presented for the refund of such court fee.\nHowever, the Court clarified that if the Registrar has any doubts or if there are materials to indicate that the applicant is not entitled to a refund, or if the judicial order does not clearly grant a refund, a joint application may be required in such situations.\nAdvocate Vishal Tambat appeared for the petitioner. \nAdvocate Savita S Ganoo, instructed by advocate Smita Thakur, appeared for the respondents."}

It causes mental pain, agony suffering and tantamount to cruelty. The allegations of extra marital affairs in relationship are serious allegations, which have to be made with all seriousness,” the bench has said.\nThe High Court was dealing with an appeal filed by a wife challenging the judgement of the Family Court, South West, Dwarka which granted a decree of divorce in favour of husband under Section 13(1)(ia) of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955.\nThe family court was told that the couple had got married in June 2014 but the relations soured very soon and the wife lodged an FIR against her father-in-law at Police Station Palam Village for offences under Sections 354/354- A/354-B/354-C of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nShe alleged that her husband was having extra-marital affairs, was a habitual drinker and even forced her to commit suicide.

{"id": "id_1625", "reference_summary": "A Delhi court on Thursday found that two Delhi Police officials made up statements to make a man an accused in a case related to the North-east Delhi riots of 2020 [State v Javed]. \nAdditional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala of the Karkardooma courts acquitted one Javed of all the charges.\nThe Court said that the investigating officer (IO) in the case and one constable who had identified Javed as one of the rioters, gave different descriptions regarding his arrest and that they contradict each other.\n“IO was probably making artificial statement in respect of the time of getting knowledge about involvement of accused Javed in the incidents being probed in this case. That could be reason for him to first claim that Ct Pawan/PW9 had told him about involvement of Javed on 27.02.2020 itself, but he could not say about the reasons for not mentioning name of Javed in the FIR,” the judge observed.\nHe further noted that the IO took advantage of a break in recording of his evidence and changed his version to make it in consonance with records of the case.\n“Similarly, PW9 [constable] went on to give wrong description of location of the grill shop (shop of PW4) [the shop where vandalism took place], while saying that it was situated at main Karawal Nagar road, near other shops i.e. shop of cooler (shop of PW3) and institute. Shop of PW4 was located in a different area of Nehru Nagar. Such false claim of PW9 shows that even he made artificial statement regarding having properly seen the mob at the time of incidents in question,” the Court said. \nThe Court further said that chargesheet was filed for multiple incidents in this case in a mechanical manner without investigating the incidents properly.\n“There was no evidence of offence u/s 436 IPC [Mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc] and such Section was also invoked without ascertaining the actual situation,” the Court stated. \nThe Delhi Police had registered a first information report (FIR) on February 25, 2020 after a complaint was received from the control room in Dayalpur police station that riots were taking place near RP Public School.\nIn total, four complaints were received. The police clubbed them together and investigated them jointly. Javed was arrested on April 14, 2020 from his residence and he allegedly made a disclosure statement that he had indulged in rioting and arson at Sherpur chowk.\nThe Court framed charges against him under Sections 147/ 148/ 427/ 435/ 436 of IPC read with Section 149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nIn a detailed order pronounced on Thursday, Judge Pramachala noted that one of the complainants, master Salman, was shot in the thigh by three boys in the morning of February 25.\nThis was not an act of a riotous mob yet the complaint by Salman was clubbed with the present FIR which was for riot by a mob. This was misconceived and not in consonance with law, the Court observed.\n“This illegality was continued in order to report this complaint in the chargesheet in this case, despite the fact that neither Salman had identified accused as one of the culprits, nor IO met any other witness to this incident, who would have claimed having seen accused as one of three boys involved in this incident,” the Court noted. \nIn September 12, 2021, Salman was examined again under Section 161 CrPC when he gave a slightly different description of the incident to say that it was a mob of some boys that attacked him. However, he denied involvement of any person in the photographs shown to him.\nThe Court concluded that investigation in Salman’s case was “illegally clubbed” with the case against Javed on the pretext of proximity to the place of incident.\nThe judge finally held that though the prosecution had established the incident of riot and vandalism, they failed to prove Javed’s presence in the unlawful assembly responsible for such incidents beyond reasonable doubt.\n\"In view of my foregoing discussions, observations and findings, accused Javed is hereby acquitted of all the charges leveled against him in this case,\" the Court ruled. \nNotably, this is the second case in the past one week where the Court has criticised Delhi Police’s conduct in investigating the riots case.\nOn August 18, the same judge had discharged Akil Ahmad, Rahis Khan and Irshad of all the charges holding that the police filed chargesheet in a “predetermined, mechanical and erroneous manner”\nThis FIR was also registered at the same police station (Dayalpur) as in the case of Javed."}

If this happens, the Lady Justice will be cursed by the tears of hundreds and thousands of deserving candidates whose future was sacrificed in lieu of money,\" the Court said.\nTherefore, ED was allowed to take the accused by air ambulance to AIIMS, Bhubeneswar in the early morning on July 25, 2022. \n\"The accused has to be taken to NSC Bose Airport, Calcutta by an ambulance of SSKM Super speciality Hospital.

On this score, this Court profitably records the view of a co-ordinate Bench of the High Court of Delhi in the case of Directorate of Enforcement v. Satyendar Kumar Jain,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also noted that the allegation against the ED that the advocate of the accused was not allowed to be present at the time of raid was palpably false since examination of the case diary revealed that Chatterjee's lawyer was present during raid conducted by the ED in the house of the accused and he had talked to the accused. \nRegarding the second direction, the Court proceeded to make adverse observations against the hospital. \n\"It is needless to say that the Doctors start medical treatment of the patient after taking HIPPOCRATIC OATH. Therefore, incredibility of medical practitioners and doctors should not be assumed. However, our experience as a common man with regard to the role of the doctors attached to SSKM Super speciality hospital is not happy. In recent past, more than one high ranking political leaders belonging to the ruling political party were arrested or directed to appear before the investigating authority for interrogation and they successfully avoided interrogation by the investigating agency taking shelter in the said hospital,\" the order said.\nThe Court, therefore, proceeded to pass the following directions:\n- The investigating agency is directed to take the accused by air ambulance to AIIMS, Bhubaneswar in the early morning on July 25, 2022. \n- The accused shall be taken to NSC Bose Airport, Calcutta by an ambulance of SSKM hospital. \n- He will be accompanied by a doctor of SSKM hospital and an advocate for the accused. \n- The AIIMS, Bhubaneswar Authority is directed to medically examine the accused by a team of specialist doctors of Cardiology, Nephrology, Respiratory Medicines and Endocrinology. \n- The AIIMS, Bhubaneswar will prepare a report and handover the copies of the same to the Investigating Officer, Medical Officer of SSKM hospital and the advocate for the accused by 3:00 p.m. on July 25, 2022.\n- The investigating officer shall forward soft copy of the above-mentioned medical report to his counterpart in Calcutta who, in turn, shall produce it before the Special Judge under PML Act. \n- The Special Judge, shall take up the hearing of the case No.ECIR/KLZO-II/19/2022 dated June 24, 2022 at 4:00 pm on July 25, 2022. \n- The investigating officer shall make necessary arrangement for the production of the accused through the medium of electronic video linkage under amending provision of clause (b) of subsection (2) of Section 167 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju and advocates Phiroze Edulj, Anamika Pandey, Amrita Pandey, Ghanshyam Pandey and Sneha Singh appeared for ED. \nAdvocates Debashish Roy, Ayan Bhattacharjee, Soumen Mohanty, Ayan Poddar, Piyush Kumar Ray and Agnish Basu represented Chatterjee."}

There are many such questions that we as an institution need to examine. Ultimately, we need to remember that it is the people’s faith and trust that needs to be maintained. Any institution that does not enjoy public confidence is of no relevance to the society. I am of the considered view that the judiciary is no exception to this,\" he said.\nRegarding incorrect judgments, the former CJI pointed out how the Supreme Court had course corrected after emergency and overruled many of its erroneous decisions and the same would the case in future as well.\n\"In the future as well, in tune with sensibilities of time, the judiciary is bound to revisit and further strengthen the fundamental liberties and dignities which make our life worthwhile. The Courts have played an important role in ensuring that the rights enshrined in the Constitution are not a dead letter.

I have held that the same was bad in law. There was no prior approval of Heritage Conservation Committee and thus matter is remitted back for public hearing. On the environmental clearance aspect, it was a non speaking order,\" Justice Khanna read out his dissenting opinion. \nThe Central government is proposing the redevelopment of the Central Vista area by constructing a new Parliament house, a new residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice-President, as well as several new office buildings and a Central Secretariat to accommodate Ministry offices.\nThe petitioners before the Supreme Court challenged a notification issued by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on December 21, 2019 regarding changes in land use for the redevelopment.\nOne of the petitioners, Rajeev Suri, assailed the alterations envisaged by the Centre arguing that they involve changes to land use and standards of population density and that the DDA is not vested with the requisite power to bring about such changes. He submitted that the power for bringing about such changes, if at all, lies with the Central government.\nAnother petitioner, Lt Col (retd) Anuj Srivastava, challenged the public hearings held to raise objections to the exercise, arguing that they were a mere formality devoid of any meaningful consequence.\nMeena Gupta, a former Secretary of the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, filed an intervention application in the pending case highlighting environmental concerns due to the redevelopment.\nThe Central government had defended the project claiming that the construction of a new Parliament building and a Central Secretariat has become an absolute necessity due to the stress on the present ones.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said that the current Parliament building, which was opened in 1927, does not adhere to fire safety norms, has a serious space crunch, and is not earthquake-proof.\n\"There is an imminent need to have a new Parliament building. The current building was built in 1927 prior to independence and was intended to house the legislative council and not a bicameral legislature we have today. The building does not conform to fire safety norms and water and sewer lines are also haphazard which is damaging the heritage nature of the building. Both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are packed. When joint sessions are held, members sit on plastic chairs diminishing the dignity of the House,\" SG Mehta had told the Court.\nOnce there is an increase in the number of seats in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha after the fresh census to be conducted next year, the building will be under stress, Mehta added. He also cited security concerns, highlighting the 2001 Parliament attack.\nRegarding construction of a new Central Secretariat, the Centre underscored the need to bring all important Ministry offices under one single building.\n“We have to run around the city to go to different ministries, increasing traffic and pollution. The policy decision is that all Central ministries have to be at one place and that place has to be one which has historical significance\", Mehta contended.\nIt was also the government's argument that all necessary statutory approvals including environmental clearances were in place and that the project cannot be scrapped merely because the petitioners felt a better process or method could have been adopted.\nUnless there was any violation of Constitutional or legal provisions, the Court should refrain from scrapping the project and there was no occasion to warrant judicial interference in the present case, Mehta submitted.\nThe Court had heard arguments in the last week of October and the first week of November last year before reserving its judgment on November 5, 2020."}

The State challenged the order before the High Court.\nJustice Sharma said an assumption to favour of a female accused without any substantive basis or valid grounds goes against the core principles of the justice system.\nThe judge added that the legal system is predicated on the objective assessment of facts rather than preconceived notions. \n“Our legal system is founded on the principle of gender neutrality, unless otherwise provided, where each individual, regardless of their gender, is held accountable for their actions in accordance with the law. Presumptions based on gender have no place within this framework, unless provided by law, as they undermine the pursuit of truth and justice,” the Court said.\nThe Court noted that the presumption in favour of the female accused was made by the trial court at the stage of framing of charge, when its primary duty was only to see whether a prima facie case was made out or not. \nIt also noted that the charge sheet was filed against ten persons including five women, while the trial court order discharging the women named only four of them. \nHowever, the trial court asked “all lady accused persons” to furnish bail bonds under Section 437A of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the High Court noted. \n“This Court is again constrained to observe that writing so in a judicial order does not reflect well on the judicial philosophy of treating all genders equally.

If such lower court is approached for bail, it shall decide the matter within four days, the High Court further held.\nSenior Advocate Amit Desai appeared for the State. Inter alia, he argued against the High Court directly entertaining the plea to release Goswami, asserting that the hierarchy of courts should not be disrupted unless there are extraordinary circumstances. He asserted,\n\"This is not a fit case for grant of interim relief. They have remedy before the trial court. They may get bail when if the trial court deems it fit. But to exercise this jurisdiction will lead to flood gate of applications.\"\nDesai added that he does not want to comment on the allegations of malice made by Goswami, since the matter is sub juice.

{"id": "id_173", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court recently held that undue delay in trial can be a ground for grant of bail to an accused charged under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act 1985 (NDPS Act), despite the stringent conditions provided under Section 37 [Mohd Muslim @ Hussain v. State (NCT of Delhi)].\nAs per Section 37 NDPS Act, the Court can grant bail to the accused person only when it is satisfied that that there are reasonable grounds for believing that he is not guilty of such offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.\nA division bench of Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Dipankar Dutta held that laws which impose stringent conditions for grant of bail, may be necessary in public interest; yet, if trials are not concluded in time, the injustice wrecked on the individual is immeasurable.\n\"Grant of bail on ground of undue delay in trial, cannot be said to be fettered by Section 37 of the Act, given the imperative of Section 436A (which requires inter alia the accused to be enlarged on bail if the trial is not concluded within specified period) which is applicable to offences under the NDPS Act too,\" the Court held.\nImportantly, the Court said that a plain and literal interpretation of the conditions under Section 37 i.e., the Court should be satisfied that the accused is not guilty and would not commit any offence, would effectively make grant of bail impossible\nTherefore, the only manner in which such special conditions as enacted under Section 37 can be considered within constitutional parameters is where the court is reasonably satisfied on a prima facie look at the material on record (whenever the bail application is made) that the accused is not guilty, the Court underscored.\n\"Any other interpretation, would result in complete denial of the bail to a person accused of offences such as those enacted under Section 37 of the NDPS Act,\" the order said.\nThe Court, therefore, granted bail to the appellant after noting that he had spent over seven years in jail in an NDPS case and trial was proceeding at snail's pace. \n\"The progress of the trial has been at a snail’s pace: 30 witnesses have been examined, whereas 34 more have to be examined,\" the Court noted.\nThe present case concerned the supply of ganja and the four accused persons were found to be in possession of 180 kilograms of ganja. \nThe appellant was arrested at the instance of the confessional statement of one of the arrested persons. \nAt the time of his arrest, the appellant was 23 years old and, he was not found in possession of the said narcotic drug.\nThe appellant was booked under Sections 20, 25 and 29 of the NDPS Act. His bail application was rejected by the District Court based on the gravity of the offences alleged, severity of punishment, and his alleged role. \nIt was also noted that the appellant had been in regular contact with the other co-accused to commit the crime, and that material witnesses were yet to be examined.\nAggrieved, the appellant moved the Delhi High Court for bail which was rejected on the ground that the appellant was prima facie in regular contact with other co-accused as indicated by the call records, and that the main accused had transferred money from his bank account to the appellant’s bank account, several times.\nThe High Court observed that there was a prima facie case against appellant and there were no grounds to rely on the exceptions of Section 37 NDPS Act.\nThis led to the appeal before the apex court.\nThe Supreme Court noted that the recovery of ganja was from the four co-accused and the appellant was only arrested at the behest of confessional statement by one of the co-accused. \nThe Court also noted that nothing was recovered from the appellant and the allegation that appellant was the mastermind was also not backed by any evidence of extensive dealing with narcotics.\nThe Court also noted that two of the co-accused have already been released on bail.\nPertinently, the Court noted that the trial was proceeding at snail's pace.\nIn light of the above facts, the Court examined the legal position as regards interpretation of Section 37.\nIt emphasised that there cannot be a plain literal interpretation of Section 37. \n\"The standard to be considered therefore, is one, where the court would look at the material in a broad manner, and reasonably see whether the accused’s guilt may be proved. The judgments of this court have, therefore, emphasized that the satisfaction which courts are expected to record, i.e., that the accused may not be guilty, is only prima facie, based on a reasonable reading, which does not call for meticulous examination of the materials collected during investigation,\" the bench said. \nThe Court acknowledged that Section 37 NDPS Act and other similar provisions with such strict conditions like Section 43D(5) of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act 1967 and Section 45 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002, have been upheld.\nHowever, such stringent provisions were enacted curtailing the provisions of bail, and restricting judicial discretion, on the basis that investigation and trials would be concluded swiftly. However, the Court noted that in the present case, the appellant has been in jail for more than seven years, with the trial moving at the snail's pace.\nIn view of the above, the Court proceeded to grant bail to the appellant. \nBefore parting, the Court also bemoaned living conditions of prisoners in Indian jails which are overcrowded.\n\"Jails are overcrowded and their living conditions, more often than not, appalling.

However, they reportedly continued broadcasting audio visual songs, clippings and scenes of the plaintiff’s copyrighted cinematographic films on their channels.\nDespite being alerted of these infringements by Shemaroo, News Nation allegedly refused to pay damages and instead defended its use of the content by citing the principles of fair use and de minimis (lacking importance).\nAs a result, the plaintiff filed an infringement suit, claiming that the defendants were not entitled to the said defence. They prayed that the defendants be refrained from utilising its content.\nAdvocate Rashmin Khandekar representing Shemaroo, argued that the defendant having previously obtained a licence for exploitation of the plaintiff's content for a fee, it cannot now claim exploitation of the content under 'fair use' domain after the agreement was terminated. It was contended that the defendant cannot argue that use of plaintiff's content is 'fair dealing' and deserves to be ignored under the principle of de minimis non curat lex. \nAdvocate Aman Kacheria representing News Nation argued that the plaintiff's information was disseminated by the defendant as a responsible news organisation in the course of its regular and ordinary business of reporting news and other programmes.\nHe contended that the defendant's use of the plaintiff's content was legal under Section 52 of the Copyright Act because it fell under the doctrine of 'fair dealing.'\nHe submitted that the instant action was barred by the principle of de minimis non curat lex because the defendant had only utilised the plaintiff's material for a very short period and with a good purpose.\nThe High Court noted that the plaintiff had accepted the request for termination of the license agreement upon certain terms, which were affirmed by the defendant.\n\"It was, inter alia, provided that using the plaintiff’s content without having a valid license would constitute infringement of the plaintiff’s copyright,\" the single-judge stated. \nThe burden of proving that the content was utilised for the purpose of reporting current events is on the defendant, the Court said. \nHowever, the defendant did not submit any evidence to support its claim that the content was used as a part of its ordinary and regular course of business and reporting news and programmes, the Court ruled. \nHence, the defendant's acts could not be excused since it was exploiting the plaintiff's content in a manner that was provided by the terminated agreement.\n\"It would be rather difficult to draw an inference that the breach of the obligation on the part of defendant, especially in the context of the prior exploitation of the plaintiff’s content under license regime, would amount to fair dealing and can be condoned on the basis of principle of de minimis,\" it said.\nThe Court, therefore, granted interim relief in favour of Shemaroo."}

A father makes his daughter’s life safe and protect her from getting hurt. But victim’s father himself has caused immeasurable pain to her....The accused does not deserve much leniency as offence committed by him is heinous which affects the fabric of life,\" the Court said.\nThe prosecution claimed that the 13-year-old girl lived with her grandparents, uncle, father, and two younger siblings. Her mother was said to have abandoned them seven years before the incident.\nThe incident came to light in May 2021, when the girl's grandma questioned her about her missed menstrual cycle. The girl then stated that her father had been subjecting her to forceful sexual abuse since the previous year.\nShe claimed that the accused used to rape her when he returned home under the influence of liquor. He allegedly sexually assaulted her at least five times.\nThe accused pleaded not guilty to the accusation. \nHis counsel argued that the house where they were living was too tiny for someone to perform such a crime without being detected by others. The lawyer said that the bogus complaint was filed against him because he used to prevent the girl from conversing with her male friends.\nIt was contended that the failure by the survivor to raise an alarm suggested that the act did not take place.\nThe judge stated that the child's refusal to raise an alarm did not cast doubt on her evidence since she was sexually assaulted by someone in authority on whom she was reliant. The Court stated that just because the living space was tiny did not mean that such activities were not feasible.\nOn the survivor's silence, the Court said that in most cases, it is due to fear.\n\"The victim’s failure to raise shouts is mainly for the reason that there is fear in the mind of children that if a close relative commits such nature of acts then what will happen to their life if they resist as the uncertainty of future loom large in their mind. Such kind of fear is real when the children are not protected in their own house and they are,\" the Court said.\nIn the present case, the victim’s mother had left her and her other siblings and so her situation was more vulnerable, the Court added. \n\"This fear of children is not addressed as they do not know that how they will be protected and cared for as they are not aware that they will get a shelter and an opportunity to lead a normal life,\" the Court observed.\nCiting provisions of the POCSO Act, it said there were rules for spreading awareness and also to ensure that the child is placed in a shelter home if needed. \nTh man was sentenced to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment along with a fine of ₹20,000 to be paid as compensation to the survivor. \nSpecial Public Prosecutor SS Joshi appeared for the State.

Hence, his case is split up,\" the Court explained. \nWhile 12 of the accused were convicted under Section 302 (murder) read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code, the remaining three accused were convicted under Section 302 (murder) read with Section 120B (criminal conspiracy). \nSreenivasan, who was the State secretary of the BJP’s OBC Morcha and a lawyer, was hacked to death by the accused at his house at Vellakinar in Alappuzha municipality on December 19, 2021, in front of his mother and wife.\nThe killing of Sreenivasan was said to be a retaliatory strike to avenge the murder of SDPI’s State secretary KS Shan at Kuppezham Junction at Mannancherry, Alappuzha, allegedly by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activists the night before.\nThe trial Court on Tuesday noted that Sreenivasan was a \"philanthropist, a benefactor of society, a good person by all means and a practicing lawyer\" who was defenceless when he was attacked by the accused. \n\"Taking into consideration the brutality of attack, the vulnerability of the victim and the diabolic notes, acts of perversion cumulatively would definitely justify the imposition of death penalty,\" the Court further commented. \nThe Court went on to remark that the brutality of the murder was apparent from the manner in which the skull and tooth of the victim were scattered following the attack mounted on him.\n\"The said commission of crime shocked the minds of people in the society and it also shocks the judicial conscience,\" the Court said. \nThe Court also noted that the convicts were office bearers holding \"responsible posts\" in their organisation, although the organisation itself was the banned PFI.\n\"The report of the State shows that the accused persons are hardcore criminals and there is no chance for reformation because they are very deeply interested in the affairs of the said organization which is widespread in the country and in case such activities are allowed to continue in society, it would definitely hamper the peace in the society. Moreover, it should be deterred, for which, a deterrent punishment is required,\" the judge added. \nOther factors considered by the court in imposing the death penalty included that the accused had believed that they were morally justified in committing the murder, and that the chances of the accused indulging in crime in the future could not be ruled out. \n\"The most important aspect is that the heinous crime was committed in the comfort zone ie., in the house of the victim, in the presence of his mother, wife and minor child and he was denuded are all showing the brutality of the crime,\" the court further noted, before imposing the death penalty. \nSpecial Public Prosecutor Prathap G Padickal represented the State. \nAdvocates PP Haris, KM Shyju, Shaiq Rasal M, Delson Devis P, Balu Aravind, Shemi Kalam Padickal, Kiran C Vinoy, Baiju Louis Mookken, Jesto Paul A, Sohail Ahammed, Yaha CS, KN Prasanth, EA Haris, John S Ralph, Vishnu Chandran, Apoorva Ramkumar, and Ralph R John represented various accused persons. \nCorrigendum: An earlier version of this article had incorrectly reported that all 15 convicts were sentenced to death, whereas the sentence is yet to be pronounced with respect to 1 of the convicts.

However, he added that the State's move was inadequate.\nWhen the Court asked Singh to approach a magistrate to register an FIR, Nankani replied that approaching the magistrate would only lead to filing of a police complaint but not a CBI probe.\nAlso before the Court were three connected pleas:\nA petition filed by Ghanshyam Upadhyay seeking the formation of a court-monitored Special Investigation Team (SIT) to look into the extortion charges alleged by Param Bir Singh.\nA plea filed by chartered accountant Mohan Bhide seeking the formation of a committee headed by a retired Supreme Court or High Court judge for investigating into the allegations.\nA plea filed by Dr. Jaishri Patil, seeking a probe by the CBI or any other independent agency into the allegations of malpractices alleged by Singh.\nAppearing for Upadhyay, Jha argued that considering the unprecedented situation where a Home Minister is involved, the Court should have taken suo motu cognizance.\nKirpekar, appearing for Bhide, stated the inquiry conducted will take away doubts from the minds of the public.\nAdvocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni opposed the plea stating that it was not maintainable.\nHe argued that Singh had placed his personal grievances in the pleadings and played the victim card. The AG went on to contend that the statements attributed to Deshmukh in Singh's letter containing the allegations were false.\nThe Court had earlier asked the counsel how it could direct for an investigation when there was no complaint filed. The Chief Justice added that the appropriate course of action would be to file a complaint, and if there was no action on the same, then the Court could be approached."}

[State v Amanatullah Khan & Ors]\nThe Court, however, ordered framing of charges against AAP's Amantullah Khan and Prakash Jarwal in the matter.\n\"Accused persons namely Arvind Kejriwal (A-3), Manish Sisodia (A-4), Rajesh Rishi (A5), Nitin Tyagi (A-6), Praveen Kumar (A-7), Ajay Dutt (A-8), Sanjeev Jha (A-9), Rituraj Govind (A-10), Rajesh Gupta (A-11), Madan Lal (A-12) and Dinesh Mohania (A-13) are discharged in the present case. Whereas, prima facie case for offences under section 186/332/353/323/34 IPC is made out against the accused persons namely Amanatullah Khan (A-1) and Prakash Jarwal (A-2),\" held Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Sachin Gupta.\nThe court stated, “It appears that the alleged incident with the complainant happened suddenly, after some of the MLAs started questioning him (then chief secretary) over some issues and in the spur of the moment, two of the aforesaid MLAs allegedly assaulted and hit him, without any conspiracy, prior meeting of minds or pre-meditation amongst the accused persons present there.”\nIt went ahead to point out that if during the course of a meeting called by the Chief Minister, whose own conduct was not suspicious at all, if something untoward had allegedly happened, that itself would neither render the meeting as an unlawful assembly nor make the presence of CM, Deputy CM and other accused MLAs as part of or acting under a criminal conspiracy or having shared a common intention.\n\"Moreover, it is clearly demonstrated from the statement under Section 164 Cr PC of the witness Mr V K Jain that the Chief Minister asked the two MLAs to refrain from any unruly behaviour. Once the Chief Minister did so, there was no occasion for the Deputy Chief Minister and other MLAs present there to do the same, especially when as per the version of said witness, the complainant himself left the meeting immediately after taking permission from the Chief Minister. Hence, the contention raised on behalf of prosecution/complainant that CM, Deputy CM and other MLAs present there did not intervene during the alleged assault, holds no ground,\" the court held.\nThe verdict also highlighted that there was no material to infer that the alleged act of assault and intimidation by some of the accused persons was done as a part of a common intention of all present there or that there was any pre-arranged plan or prior meeting of minds.\n\"Moreover, even calling of such meeting at 12 midnight by the Chief Minister, in which the complainant, was asked to attend and answer the MLAs, cannot be considered as part of criminal conspiracy or design amongst the accused persons, to assault and threaten the complainant, in order to pressurise him... Complainant was none other than the senior most bureaucrat of the Government of NCT of Delhi. Even complainant himself stated in his complaint that he was discharging his official duties, while he attended the said meeting at the CM residence,\" the order stated.\nThe Court said it was not to merely act as a \"post-office\" or a \"mouthpiece of the prosecution\" but consider the broad probabilities of the case.\nThe Delhi police had chargesheeted Kejriwal, Sisodia and others under Sections 186/323/332/342/353/504/506(ii)/120B/109/114/149/34 and 36 of the IPC.\nThe lawmakers included, Amanatullah Khan, Prakash Jarwal, Nitin Tyagi, Rituraj Govind, Sanjeev Jha, Ajay Dutt, Rajesh Rishi, Rajesh Gupta, Madan Lal, Parveen Kumar and Dinesh Mohania.\nAdditional public prosecutor Atul Srivastava had argued that the alleged assault on Prakash was an “unfortunate and shameful” incident where the senior-most officer of the State was criminally intimidated and assaulted.\nHe stated that the alleged assault took place at the CM’s residence where the 11 MLAs had a meeting with Anshu Prakash. \"We say Atiti Devo Bhava where guests should be honourably treated, but treat them like this?\" Shrivastava had said.\nIt was alleged that the bureaucrat was forced to \"consent on a certain thing\" in the meeting. \"He was intimidated and assaulted by the two persons.

It takes into its fold varied philosophies, beliefs, and ethos with ease; and it has been so for the past several centuries,” observed the High Court.\nVidyarambham is derived from vidya, which means ‘knowledge’, and arambham which means ‘start’. This means it is a ritual that marks the formal introduction of toddlers to writing and syllabi.\nThe plea was filed by a man professing to be a Hindu alleging that the ‘Vidyarambham’ conducted by the Mattannur Municipality was forcing children to recite and write the prayers contrary to their religious beliefs and the ethos of ‘Sanatana Dharma’.\nHe, therefore, approached the High Court to intervene and stop the concerned authorities from going forward with the Vidyarambham program.\nThe Court took note of the submissions made by the authorities of the concerned municipality that they have provided an option to the parents to choose the prayer they want their children to recite during Vidyarambham.\nJustice Ramachandran further acknowledged that the Mattannur Municipality was conducting the Vidyarambham in a library with secular thought.\n“Any attempt by anyone, much less respondents 1 and 2 (concerned authorities), to color this with any other shade, by forcing or inducing children to write or recite any prayer contrary to their parent’s choice would, therefore, be anathema to free thought and freedom of belief,” the High Court emphasised in its order.\nTherefore, the Court decided not to intervene since it was clear that the authorities had provided an option for parents to choose the prayer according to their religious belief for Vidyarambam.\n“‘Vidyarambham’ - which semantically means ‘commencement of education or knowledge’. There is nothing to imply therefrom that it is proposed to be conducted in a particular fashion, or in a particular manner; but solely that the parents can apply for their children to be initiated into education through certain prayers - the options of which have been indicated,” said the High Court.\nAs long as the programme is conducted with a secular thought and without breach of any law and with full volition of the participants, I do not think this Court needs to intervene in any manner whatsoever, the judge said.\nThe Court, however, made it clear that the event must be conducted respecting individual choices.\n\"The event mentioned in Ext.P1, must be conducted by respondents 1 and 2 implicitly respecting this, as also the individual choices to be made by the parents. I caution that any action on their part to cause a tear on the constitutional fabric – ingrained with liberty to all its citizens of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship – can never be countenanced,\" the judgment said.\nWith this, the Court disposed of the plea.\nThe petitioner was represented by advocates C Rajendran, RS Sreevidya, BK Gopalakrishnan and Manu M."}

The Bangalore ISKCON claimed that it was aggrieved by the supposed implication of that judgment that ISKCON, Mumbai was the sole and exclusive registered proprietor of the mark. The grievance was that the Registrar of Trademarks allegedly refused to entertain its claim to the mark in light of the 2020 order passed in the suit filed by ISKCON Mumbai.\nIn the present case, a Division Bench of Justices GS Patel and Gauri Godse noted that the observations in the 2020 suit were limited only to ISKCON being a well-known mark. Since ISKCON Bangalore was not a party to that suit, it was free to establish an exclusive or a concurrent title to the mark.\n\"Clarify (to the Registrar of Trademarks) that it's not a finding against you. It is open for you to establish that you have an exclusive or a concurrent title,\" Justice Patel said.\nIt stated that the single-judge's order should not be construed as finally determining any claims or contentions, either exclusive or joint, with respect to the proprietorship of the mark.\n\"Those contentions are left open for the appropriate proceedings before any forum including, we clarify, before the Registrar of Trademarks. The Registrar of Trademarks, is therefore, bound by the finding that ISKCON is well-known mark. As to who is entitled to the use of that mark or can be held to be its registered proprietor are questions expressly left open,\" the Court said. \n\"In any case, Mumbai and Bangalore are at war in the Supreme Court,\" it said before dismissing the appeal.\nThe Court was referring to another dispute between ISKCON Bangalore and ISKCON Mumbai over the former's property in Bangalore.\nIn 2011, ISKCON Mumbai was declared to be the rightful owner of the property by the Karnataka High Court. The High Court held ISKCON Bangalore was not a legally constituted body, but a branch of the Mumbai outfit. Consequently, it meant that ISKCON Bangalore was not an independent entity. \nThe appeal against the order is now pending before the Supreme Court.\nIn the case before the Bombay High Court, Senior Advocate Dr Birendra Saraf appeared for ISKCON Bangalore while Senior Advocate Veerendra Tulzapurkar with Advocate Hiren Kamod appeared for ISKCON Mumbai."}

[V Vasanta Mogli v. The State of Telangana and Ors]\nA Bench of Chief Justice Ujjal Bhuyan and Justice CV Bhaskar Reddy found that this legislation intruded upon the private sphere of transgender persons and was manifestly arbitrary.\n\"This legislation is violative of the human rights of the third gender community besides it is an intrusion into their private sphere as well as an assault on their dignity. It is thus offensive of both the right to privacy and the right to dignity of transgender persons. It is not only violative of Article 14 but is also clearly violative of Article 21 of the Constitutional of India,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court noted that the Act had proceeded on the assumption that eunuchs, as a class, were criminal. In this regard, it was observed that the Act had grouped together certain tribes which were declared as criminal tribes and eunuchs under a single classification.\nIt was held that there was not an iota of doubt that the Act was anathema to the Constitutional philosophy of India.\n\"This is not only arbitrary and unreasonable but is also manifestly arbitrary in as much as it criminalises the entire community of eunuchs,\" the Court held.\nThe ruling was passed after examining the Supreme Court's judgments in the NALSA case, the KS Puttaswamy case and Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India.\nNotably, the Court also directed the Central and State governments to take measures to provide for reservation to transgender persons in educational admissions and recruitment in public employment. \n\"State of Telangana is directed to issue government orders/administrative instructions providing for reservation to persons belonging to the transgender community in matters of admission into educational institutions and recruitment to Government and public services,\" the judgment said.\nIt has further directed that the benefits of the Aasara Pension Scheme, which was introduced by the State of Telangana in 2014, must be extended to transgender persons. \nThe Telangana Eunuchs Act of 1919 mandated the maintenance of a register of eunuchs residing in the city of Hyderabad if they were suspected of kidnapping and emasculating boys or of committing or abetting unnatural offences.\nThe Act permitted the arrest of transgender persons without a warrant if they were found in female clothing or ornamented or singing, dancing, or participating in public entertainment in a street or a public place. A jail term of up to two years was also prescribed for the same. \nA transgender person found in the company of a boy below the age of sixteen years could also be arrested without a warrant and imprisoned for up to two years. \nA public interest litigation (PIL) was moved challenging this law. The Court heard this PIL along with two related petitions. One related plea sought directions to the State to provide reservations to transgender persons in educational institutions and public employment. \nThe third plea requested that transgender individuals be granted payment of three months' social security pension under the Aasara Scheme.\nThe petitioners contended that the Act was outdated and was a complete anachronism with modern-day life and thinking. They said that the law was discriminatory as it criminalised the transgender community without any basis. \nFurther, they contended that the Act imposed arbitrary restrictions on the freedom of speech and expression of the transgender community while also breaching their fundamental right to privacy.\nThe petitioners highlighted that the Act was against the letter and spirit of the Supreme Court's decision in NALSA v. Union of India, which had declared transgenders as the third gender.\nOn the other hand, the State government contended that the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act enacted by the Central government covered only welfare measures to transgender persons. \nThere was no provision for specific offences attributed to transgender persons such as kidnapping or emasculating boys or committing unnatural offences, the State submitted. The State said that the Act under challenge governed and addressed such offences. \nThe Court, however, disagreed with the State's stance and ruled that the Act was unconstitutional.\nIt also ordered the State Welfare Board for transgender persons to include the Member Secretary of the Telangana State Legal Services Authority as one of its members. The Court emphasized that the Board should be a permanent body, although individual members may have limited tenures.\nAdditionally, the Court has called for the Welfare Board to oversee various measures taken by the State to uplift the transgender community, including the proper implementation of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, and the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Rules, 2020.\nSenior Advocate Jayna Kothari and Advocate K Sai Sandeep Pareekshit appeared for the petitioners.

The order reads, \n\"For the aforesaid reasons, the impugned reservation (under NLSIU Amendment Act) is struck down as the intelligible differentia has no nexus to the object sought to be achieved and therefore, does not meet the twin tests under Article 14 of the Constitution.\"\nKarnataka High Court\nThe Bench held that the NLSIU Amendment Act was ultra vires and contrary to the provisions of the parent Act.\nThe Court further held that the state government does not have the power to enact the Amendment Act that brought in the 25% domicile reservation for admissions to NLSIU.\n\"Therefore, the State Legislature does not have any power or authority under the Act (NLSIU Act) to mandate the Law School (NLSIU) to horizontally reserve 25% of the seats for the students of Karnataka.\"\nAdding on, the Court said,\n\"By this, we do not mean that it does not have the legislative competence under Schedule VII of the Constitution of India...We note that the state did not retain or reserve any role for itself in the matter of administration, management and control of the Law School.

When an application under the Act is transferred to Additional District Judge by District Judge, the Additional District Judge is competent to consider said application as a Judge of a District Court and his competence cannot be challenged for want of authorization (from High Court) under Section 4 A of the said Act,\" the Court held.\nWhile it is true that a judge of a Fast Track Court is appointed as Additional District Judge on the basis of ad hoc promotion and their service is subject to regularization in the cadre of District Judge entry level on their passing limited competitive examination or on promotion on the basis of seniority-cum-merit, but like a District Judge or regular Additional District Judge it has power to hear all the cases both civil and criminal which a District Judge or a regular Additional Judge can hear and dispose of, the High Court held.\n\"This Court is of view that Additional District Judge, Fast Track Court is not a subordinate to District Court so far as judicial function is concerned and as such Additional Fast Track Court is competent to hear matter under Guardian and Wards Act and there is no need of any general or special order from the High Court to empower Fast Track Court under Section 4 A of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 to dispose of any proceeding under the Act,\" the order further said.\nIn the present matter, one Mukat Bose, father of a minor child had filed an application under Section 24 and 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, before the District Judge, Howrah who subsequently transferred the case to the Additional District Judge, Fast Track Court for disposal. \nThe said application was challenged by his wife before the High Court on the ground that a Fast Track Court is subordinate to a District Court and not empowered by the High Court to hear matter under the said Act.\nThe Court recorded that it is an admitted position of law that the Calcutta High Court has not empowered any officer subordinate to the District Judge to hear and dispose of any proceeding under the Guardians and Wards Act. \nFurther, Section 4A of the said Act provides that it is the District Judge who has the original power to hear a matter under the Act unless the High Court empowers any officer exercising original civil jurisdiction subordinate to a District Court to dispose of any proceeding under the said Act.\n\"The District Judge may by order in writing may transfer any case under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 at any stage of the proceeding pending before it for disposal to any officer subordinate to the District Court, empowered by the High Court under sub Section 1 of Section 4A,\" the Court further noted.\nHowever, Court placed reliance on a decision of a coordinate bench of the High Court in which it was held that an Additional District Judge who discharges identical judicial functions like that of a District Judge are not subordinate to a District Judge, and competent to consider and hear the matter under the said Act.\nBut the Court clarified that an Additional District Judge cannot independently take up applications under the Act.\nIt is only when an application is transferred by a District Judge to the Additional District Judge, then the Additional District Judge is competent to consider the said application as a Judge of a District Court and his competence cannot be challenged for want of authorisation under Section 4A. \n\"It is only the District Judge who can receive the application under the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 and the District Judge by order in writing transfer the cases under the Guardians and Wards Act to the Court of a Regular Additional District Judge and as well as to the Court of Additional District Judge, First Track Court for disposal at any stage of the proceeding upon compliance of the requisite formalities.\" the single-Judge held."}

After the interview, the petitioner was ranked first but nine members of the Panchayat committee, including the Vice President, were opposed to appointing her, for the reason that her place of residence was not within said panchayat.\nHowever, according to the petitioner, the ulterior motive behind this was to appoint a person who was a resident of the panchayat but had scored the least marks.\nTherefore, she approached the High Court seeking to quash the resolution of the panchayat members as arbitrary and unconstitutional and to declare her appointment based on the rank list.\nDuring the pendency of the case, the panchayat decided to not effect appointment to the post for the reason that they were facing a financial crunch due to the pandemic. So the petitioner amended her prayer to quash that decision. \nAdvocate Thulasi K Raj, appearing for the petitioner, contended that the panchayat is bound to appoint the petitioner based on her rank and the decision not to appoint persons from outside the panchayat was against the constitutional guarantee under Article 16 of the Constitution of India.\nAdvocate OD Sivadas, appearing for the panchayat, countered by saying that since a decision had been taken to not appoint anyone to the post, the question raised in the petition had been rendered moot.\nHowever, Senior Government Pleader V Venugopal concurred with the petitioner that her non-appointment for the reason given was illegal. Moreover, he submitted that, place of residence has no relevance in appointments under the MNREGS.\nThe Court noted that the dictum in Kailash Chand Sharma has been followed by the Kerala High Court in a series of decisions. \nHence, it deemed it appropriate to set aside the decision of the Panchayat Committee refusing appointment to the petitioner for the sole reason that she is not a resident of Annamanada.\nWith regard to the decision of the Committee to not appoint anyone to the post, the Court ordered the State government to decide on whether whether the panchayat can unilaterally decide not to fill up a post created for the purpose of implementation of the MGNREGA Scheme."}

Further, the trial being conducted by the trial court in such a casual manner that all the witnesses were recalled after 7 months and such attitude is deprecated by the Hon’ble Apex Court. The reasoning of the trial court does not inspire the consciousness of the court and the trial court on surmises and assumptions presumed certain things and acquitted the accused,\" the judgment said. \nThe State has filed an appeal challenging the judgment of acquittal passed by the Sessions Judge. The case of the prosecution was that the the accused had been sexually assaulting his daughter for 9 months, and had wrongfully confined her in a house to sexually assault her. The mother of the child was deaf and dumb. \nWhen the child was at her maternal grandmother's house, the accused went there to take her back home, upon which she refused to accompany him, and disclosed the sexual assault to her grandmother. The grandmother took the child to the police station and a complaint was lodged against the father. \nFollowing the filing of the complaint, investigation was conducted and a chargesheet was submitted against the accused for offences punishable under Sections 376(1) (rape), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 4 (penetrative sexual assault) 8 (sexual assault) and 12 (sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO)\nAfter hearing the arguments, the Special Judge decided that the evidence of the victim, the grandmother, and other witnesses, including the medical evidence was not trustworthy and acquitted the accused for the offences alleged against him. Aggrieved by the acquittal, the State appealed to the High Court. \nThe State contended that the judgement and order of acquittal was contrary to law, the facts, and the evidence on record, and that sufficient material had been placed by the prosecution, which was ignored by the trial court. \nThe counsel for the respondent-accused argued that the victim-girl was a tutored witness, and considering the animosity between the accused and the maternal grandmother of the child, her evidence could not be trustworthy. \nHe also said that just a day before the Section 164 statement of the victim, she had undergone medical examination where it was noted that she had depression. The very next day her statement was recorded which established that she was tutored, and her competency to give a statement was not recorded by the Magistrate, he submitted.\nThe court framed the following questions for consideration: \ni) Whether the prosecution proved the guilt of the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 376(1), 342 and 506 of IPC and Sections 4, 8 and 12 of POCSO Act as alleged beyond all reasonable doubt?\nii) Whether the judgment and order of acquittal passed by the trial court is perverse, erroneous and arbitrary?\nWhile considering the case, the Court noted that initially, the child witness had not been cross examined by the defence. However, she was recalled as a witness after 7 months for a cross examination, during which she admitted that the accused-father used to take care of her, advise her not leave the house in the evening, and was strict with her. \nIt was further elicited from the child that the relationship between her grandmother and the accused father was not cordial, that they would quarrel regularly and he used to advise her not to visit the grandmother. Even on the date of lodging the complaint, they had quarreled. However, in her examination in chief, the child had deposed regarding the sexual assault committed by the accused, the Court noted. \nThe Court noted that although the defence cross examined the victim and elicited testimony regarding the strained relationship between the grandmother and the accused, and that the complaint was lodged at the instance of the grandmother, the incidents of sexual assault had not been denied by the child.\nIt was suggested that the allegations were as per the say of the grandmother, but when a suggestion was made to the child that the accused never behaved indecently with her, she denied it. \n\"Hence, it is evident that the accused tried to win over the victim in these 7 months and there was an attempt, but the evidence discloses that the accused did committed sexual assault on the victim,\" the Court observed. \nThe Court said that the Magistrate who had recorded the statement of the victim had deposed that when the child was brought to the court along with her grandmother by the police, she was crying. For ten minutes, she consoled the victim and the girl expressed her willingness to disclose the incidents of sexual assault, which was recorded by the Magistrate. \n\"Interestingly, though the evidence of this witness recorded on 23.01.2016, the cross examination was held on September 8, 2016 after recalling the witness. It discloses that, defence has developed a tendency not to cross-examine the witnesses on the same day and the conduct is completely against the intention of the legislation in incorporating Section 309 of CrPC\", the Court noted. \nThe Court further noted that since it was statement under Section 164 of CrPC, administration of oath is permissible as the statement is given by the victim and not by an accused.\nThe Court said that the evidence of the victim, the judicial officer who recorded her statement, the medical officer, and the grandmother of the victim were all relevant, and that their evidence was consistent.\nThe victim girl and the grandmother both supported the case of the prosecution, there was no denial of the sexual assault during the cross examination, and there was no reason for the two witnesses to give false evidence, the Court further observed.\nIt also did not accept the arguments regarding the dispute between the grandmother and the accused, and how their animosity influenced the victim girl. \nThe grandmother is the mother-in-law of the accused, and there are no strong circumstances to show that she would risk the life of her granddaughter and daughter, the Court said.\nFurther, there was no reason for the victim to give evidence against her own father, the court noted, while observing that the 164 statement, the evidence of the victim, and the complaint were all in consonance with each other. \nThe Court noted that the trial court had not considered the position of the child and trauma she underwent while facing sexual assault. The trial court failed to consider the fact that there was no reason for her to give false evidence against her own father. \nReferring to the judgement of the Supreme Court in Vinod Kumar v. State of Punjab, the Court noted that there are guidelines for conducting a criminal trial, and that witnesses must not be called for cross examination after a long span of time, as it is against the concept of a proper and fair trial:\n\"In fact, it is not all appreciable to call a witness for cross-examination after such a long span of time. It is imperative if the examination-in- chief is over, the cross-examination should be completed on the same day. If the examination of a witness continues till late hours the trial can be adjourned to the next day for cross-examination,\" the Court said.\nIn the present case, the victim and other witnesses were called for cross examination after a long span of time, the court noted, terming the conduct of the trial court as mechanical, and one which allowed a miscarriage of justice.\nThe Court, thus, allowed the appeal of the State and sentenced the accused under Section 376(1) of the IPC read with Section 6 of POCSO. \nAdditional Special Public Prosecutor VM Banakar represented the State and Advocates ZM Hattarki and Mahantesh Hiremath represented the accused."}

Additionally, he has been found to have violated provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act; converting property for his own use and for taking illegal gratification.\nApart from Ray, the court also convicted two former senior officials of the Ministry of Coal Pradip Kumar Banerjee and Nitya Nand Gautam, as well as the Director of Castron Technologies Limited, Mahendra Kumar Aggarwalla.\nThe case pertains to irregularities in the allocation of a Jharkhand coal block in 1999, when Ray was Minister of State for Coal in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.\nThere was a question raised by the accused as to the legal validity of the chargesheet filed against them by the CBI and the cognizance taken on the basis of this. It was argued that prior sanction was required before proceedings were initiated against them, since Ray, Gautam, and Banerjee were public servants. The Special Judge observed that all of them had demitted office at the time the chargesheet was filed and so they were no longer public servants for the application of the Prevention of Corruption Act, insofar as their prosecution was concerned. \nThe amendment to the Act (Section 19) that required sanction to be obtained prior to initiating criminal prosecution even against retired public servants was held as not applicable to the accused. The Judge arrived at the conclusion because their prosecution commenced before the Amendments took effect, and that changes in procedural law did not ordinarily operate retrospectively.\nThe sentence is expected to be pronounced on October 14. \nAll of the accused in the case have been summoned to the Special Court in Delhi for the verdict.\nRead the Judgment:"}

The unfair investigation has made the accused suffer the ordeal of long trial and undergo the sentence for the crime which was never committed by them,” the judgment said.\nThe Court, therefore, directed the State to pay a compensation of ₹50,000 each to the accused-woman and her son.\n“In the case under consideration, we find that no word can comfort the agony of respondents-accused; however, ends of justice would be met if respondents are compensated at the cost of prosecution. We hereby direct the appellant-State to pay compensation of ₹50,000/- each to both the accused within four weeks,” the Court ordered.\nIt further cautioned the prosecution agencies and asked them to carry out investigation in a prudent manner and added that the trial courts shall also judiciously assess the material placed on record so that no innocent has to bear the torment of incarceration.\nThese observations were made by the bench as it rejected an appeal filed by the Delhi Police challenging the judgement dated August 20, 2019 passed by a sessions court by which the accused were acquitted of the offence of murder.\nOn February 19, 2014, a two-year-old girl died while she was at home with her grandmother. The parents of the child were divorced and the custody was with the father.\nThe maternal grandfather of the child raised a suspicion that the child was killed by her paternal grandparents and the post-mortem also revealed that there were 24 ante mortem external injuries on the body of the child. The cause of death was stated to be empty stomach and shock as a result of ante-mortem injury to head caused by blunt force impact.\nThe trial court acquitted the child’s father and grandmother of the offences of murder, but ordered them to undergo imprisonment for six months for offences under Section 23 of Juvenile Justice Act, 2000.\nThe Delhi Police challenged the order and said that the accused should be convicted for murder as well. \nAfter considering the case, the High Court noted that the father of the child was not even home when she fell and died. The Court said that it would be misplaced to assume that the father and grandmother deliberately neglected the child when she fell down.\nIt noted the statement of the doctor who conducted the post-mortem that the scratch marks on the body of the child could be possible if she was suffering from eczema and dryness of skin.\n“It seems the iron rod and danda (stick) were planted by lady Constable Babita. Moreover, no blood stains or marks were present at the crime spot. On the other hand, the grandmother herself rushed to the hospital carrying the victim child after she fell and sustained injuries.”\nThe Court, therefore, concluded that accused were not even guilty of the offence under the Juvenile Justice Act and the trial court erred in convicting them.\n“Hence, in the interest of justice, the respondents /accused are acquitted of the offences under Section 23 of the Justice Juvenile Act, 2000 also,” the High Court ordered.\nIt finally cautioned the prosecution department not to file appeals in a casual manner where there is no material to establish that the trial court acted in total disarray.\n“Such types of cases cause loss to the public exchequer, precious public time of the courts, energy and time of the prosecution which otherwise can be utilized for the good cause.”\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Shubhi Gupta appeared for the State.\nAdvocate Krishan Gopal appeared for the father and grandmother of the deceased child."}

Even otherwise, when a question arises as to what exactly the witness had stated in his/her evidence, it is the original deposition of the witness which has to be taken into account and not the translated memorandum in English prepared by the Presiding Judge,\" the Court explained.\nThe Court made these observations while disposing of an appeal preferred by the accused in a rape case that involved allegations of false promise to marry.\nIt acquitted the appellant after noting that each and every breach of promise to marry would not amount to a false promise or, consequentially, \"rape\" as per Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nIn its judgment, the Court also noticed that the deposition of the prosecutrix in this case was recorded by the trial court in English even though she had deposed in her vernacular language.\nThe Bench went on to take critical note that this practice is followed in other criminal trials as well, i.e. where depositions or testimonies of the witnesses which are given in the vernacular language are recorded in the English language only, as translated by the judge.\nThis prompted the Court to highlight that trial courts should comply with the provisions of Section 277 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,1973 (CrPC), while recording the testimony of the witnesses.

According to him, he was left with a wounded pride, which resulted in the brutal death of his wife”, the Court said.\nIt, therefore, set aside his conviction for murder under Section 302 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and instead convicted him for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 IPC.\nThe accused-husband had killed his wife using a knife inflicting 26 stab and incised wounds.\nThe Bench also remarked that in every alternate case they were dealing with the murder of a wife by the husband who violently attacked his wife in the moment of grave and sudden provocation by the wife. \n\"There is physical violence, there is sexual violence, however, this sort of physical violence is less seen amongst women even in a moment of anger and in all probabilities, it is the mother in a woman which supersedes her element of physical violence. There could be psychological violence by women,\" the Bench observed. \nThe accused, Pravin Khimji Chauhan, had been convicted under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to life by the Raigad Sessions Court, Maharashtra. \nThe crime was registered against him, after he voluntarily made a statement to the police confessing to the crime and identifying his wife's body after committing the offence.\nHe challenged the order in appeal before the High Court seeking a sympathetic view from the Court.\nIt was the appellant's case, that the act committed was not premeditated. He argued that he lost self-control after being provoked by his wife and hence amounted assault upon her.\nAccording to Chauhan, his wife had held a knife against him, and his attack on her was an act of self-defence.\nThe prosecution however opposed the appeal by stating that the number of injuries inflicted on the deceased were as many as 26 blows and hence he deserved no sympathy.\nNoting that both parties had acted in a fit of anger, the Bench remarked that they almost forgot their children during the incident. \n\"The mother died and the father was thrown to the gallows by his own act,\" the bench stated.\nThe Court noted from the injury on the appellant's palm, that he may have acted in self-defence.\nThe Court also noted that the marriage of the accused as well as the deceased had failed on two occasions before they got married to each other. \nFurther, after examining the phone call records he had started suspecting the honesty of his wife in their marital relationship.\n\"At the time of incident, they were quarreling. The tempers were high. It is the case of the accused that the conduct of his wife at the relevant time was beyond reproach. According to him, he had maintained his cool for quite sometime. However, he lost it when she brought the knife from the kitchen and provoked him to hurt her if he could. Probably, the chauvinism in him has arisen.

He voluntarily called upon his family and relatives and admitted the guilt before he approached the police station.\nTaking into consideration the circumstances in which the incident has occurred, the Court concluded that the present seemed to be a case of culpable homicide (Section 304) and not murder. \nIn view of this, imprisonment of 10 years would meet the ends of justice, the Court held.\nThe same bench had recently commuted the sentence of another convict recently after observing that there was grave and sudden provocation when the wife publicly called the husband impotent.\nAdvocate Farhana Shah appeared for the appellant.

{"id": "id_313", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday observed that the failure to report cases of sexual offences against children is a serious crime and is often done to shield offenders. (State of Maharashtra and anr v. Dr Maroti)\nA Bench of Justices Ajay Rastogi and CT Ravikumar took a dim view of the Bombay High Court quashing a First Information Report (FIR) and chargesheet in a case relating to the unreported sexual abuse of 17 minor tribal girls, even when a prima facie case was made out against the accused. It held,\n\"...non-reporting of sexual assault against a minor child despite knowledge is a serious crime and more often than not, it is an attempt to shield the offenders of the crime of sexual assault.\"\nThe Court noted that Sections 19(1) and 21 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act provide for those not informing authorities of such offences to be prosecuted. In this regard, it said,\n\"Certainly, such provisions are included in with a view to ensure strict compliance of the provisions under the POCSO Act and thereby to ensure that the tender age of children is not being abused and their childhood and youth is protected against exploitation.\"\nThe case arose from a 2019 criminal complaint filed for offences under the POCSO Act allegedly committed against minor tribal girls at Rajura town in Maharashtra's Chandrapur district. \nThe hostel superintendent of the school where the girls studied was the prime accused. One of the school's doctors was also made accused after it was found that the survivors had approached him after the incidents, but he had not acted on the same. \nThe Nagpur Bench of the High Court, however, quashed the proceedings against the doctor after observing that there was no evidence to implicate him in the crime. It relied on statements of other witnesses and an analysis of the proof mentioned in the chargesheet. The State then moved the Supreme Court in appeal. \nThe top court at the outset observed that it was 'pained' with the order under challenge, as a legitimate prosecution under the POCSO Act had been 'throttled at the threshold'. This was done without permitting the materials in support of it to see the light of the day, the judges stated. \nThe Bench noted that a legal obligation is cast upon relevant authorities to report offences under the POCSO Act.\n\"Such obligation is also bestowed on person who has apprehension that an offence under this Act is likely to be committed,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court explained how reporting such offences helps nab the culprit and have their medical examination done promptly. \n\"...a prompt reporting of the commission of an offence under POCSO Act would enable immediate examination of the victim concerned and at the same time, if it was committed by an unknown person, it would also enable the investigating agency to commence investigation without wasting time and ultimately to secure the arrest and medical examination of the culprit. There can be no two views that in relation to sexual offences medical evidence has much corroborative value.\"\nThe Bench also touched upon how, if the investigating officer's final report made out a prima facie case, the truthfulness, sufficiency or admissibility of evidence are not subject to review by the High Court.

Accordingly, this Court is of the considered view that the sentence of rigorous imprisonment for life would be an appropriate sentence,\" the Bench held.\nThe High Court also reduced the fine imposed on Khan from ₹11 lakh to ₹1.15 lakh. \nIt added that the benefit of Section 428 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) shall be available to him.\nOn September 19, 2008, a team of Delhi Police was conducting a raid at Batla House to arrest the terrorist belonging to Indian Mujahideen. The terrorists were alleged to be involved in the serial blasts at several locations in Delhi a week earlier. At least 30 people were killed in these blasts.\nAccording to the prosecution case, when the Delhi Police team reached Batla House, a gunfight ensued. The police team was trapped in the drawing-room of the said house and was forced to resort to fire in self-defence.\nDuring the shootout, Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma and other police personnel sustained bullet injuries. While one of the terrorists present in the drawing-room also sustained bullet injuries, two of them including Ariz Khan managed to escape from the flat through the main door.\nAfter being declared a proclaimed offender in 2009, Ariz Khan was finally arrested in 2018.\nIn its judgement, the trial court held that the abhorrent and brutal act of firing on police party without any provocation itself showed that Khan was not only threat to the society but was also an enemy of the State.\n“Convict on account of his despicable act has forfeited his right to live. After balancing mitigating circumstances against aggravating circumstances, it is concluded that it is a rarest of the rare case where convict deserves maximum sentence provided under law. It is the level of magnitude, decree of brutality, attitude and mindset of wrongdoer behind the crime alongwith other factors which make it a rarest of the rare case.. Interest of justice will be met if convict is awarded death penalty.\", the Court said.\nA fine of ₹11 lakh was also imposed on Khan, out of which ₹10 lakh were to be released as compensation to the wife of the deceased police officer's wife.\nThe matter was then sent to the Delhi High Court for confirmation of the death penalty.\nKhan also filed an appeal against the judgement. \nAdvocates MS Khan, Prashant Prakash, Qausar Khan and Rahul Sahan represented Ariz Khan. \nDelhi Police was represented through Special Counsel Rajesh Mahajan along with advocates Asha Tiwari, Jyoti Babbar, Ranjeeb Kamal Bora and Kuldeep Chauhan."}

They were charged with various offences under the the Indian Penal Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and the Foreigners Act. \nFinding the allegations against them unsubstantiated, a Bench of Justices VM Despande and Amit B Borkar of the Nagpur Bench of the High Court ruled:\nThe Bench held that compelling the applicants to undergo trial for the said offences would cause grave injustice.\nOn violation of visa rules\nContrary to the State's stance that the attendees preached and propagated their beliefs in a violation of visa rules, the Court found that the attendees only learnt about Indian Islamic culture and studied the scriptures in their native languages during their stay in India. Barring almost identical statements made by the witnesses arraigned, there was no proof, not even prima facie, of visa rule violations.\nOn spread of COVID-19\nThe attendees had been in isolation and under medical supervision during their stay, and their tests had returned a negative result. The Court concluded that there was no material to record that they \"had indulged in any act which was likely to spread infection of COVID -19.\" The judgment reads,\nOn disobeying a rule promulgated by a public servant\nThe prosecution alleged that the attendees violated a rule that mandated persons flying in from countries with a high incidence of COVID-19 to voluntarily report to a designated control room. The State asserted that the attendees violated Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, which describes the offence of disobedience to a public servant's command. \nFinding that the Sub-Inspector of Police had filed a chargesheet and forwarded it to a Magistrate who had taken cognizance, the Court ruled that this was a violation of procedure. As per a Supreme Court ruling, which the Court found applicable to Section 188 as well, a public servant such as a tehsildar was to have forwarded the complaint in question.\nIt was stated:\nFurther, the Court recorded that there was no indication of a violation of the provisions of the Disaster Management Act as well, from the material produced.\nHolding the FIR filed as well as the cognizance taken to have been defective in law, the High Court annulled the report on this count as well.\nTaking into consideration all of these reasons, the FIRs against the attendees were quashed.\nNotably, the attendees had placed reliance on the Bombay High Court's recent ruling that quashed proceedings against another batch of Markaz attendees. \nAs per Justice Nalawade's strongly-worded opinion in that case,\n\"... A political Government tries to find the scapegoat when there is pandemic or calamity and the circumstances show that there is probability that these foreigners were chosen to make them scapegoats. The aforesaid circumstances and the latest figures of infection in India show that such action against present petitioners should not have been taken.

Since the original product would not be kept by him, no customer would have the benefit of comparison to know that they were at risk of purchasing a fake product.\nJustice Menon was dealing with an appeal filed by Burberry against an order of the Additional District Judge (ADJ) at Patiala House Court that refused relief and returned a finding that the fashion house had failed to prove that the goods seized by the local commissioner from the stall owner were counterfeit. The benefit of doubt in this case would go to the defendant, the district judge had ruled.\nThe High Court ruled that a perusal of the lower court's judgment revealed that it had completely misdirected itself in placing undue emphasis on the proof of counterfeit products. The issue before it was actually whether there was an infringement of the registered trademark or whether the defendant was passing off his own goods as those of the plaintiff, the High Court noted.\n“Had this been the focus of attention, the learned Trial Court would have been quick to note that the proof required was not of whether there was counterfeiting, but of infringement by use of the registered trade marks unauthorizedly. Had the products been not counterfeit, even then, if the trade marks used were to mislead the public regarding the origin of the products, a case for injunction would have been made out.”\nThe High Court found it strange that the trial court, while dealing with the civil matter, chose to decide the case on the standard of criminal jurisprudence to hold that the case had not been proved beyond doubt.\nIt noted that the report of the local commissioner, appointed by the trial court, recorded that she had found counterfeit/infringing goods with the defendant which were then seized. This should have been enought to prove Burberry's case for injunction, the High Court held. \nThe judgment said that unlike in criminal cases, in a case of infringement of registered trademarks or passing off, similarity of the marks used is to be considered and there is no call to have an expert witness testify to the use of an identical or similar trademark.\n“The emphasis is on the branding and not on the manufacture of the goods in question. It is the false branding that results in the product being counterfeit.”\nBased on these findings, the High Court set aside the judgement of the ADJ and granted relief to Burberry.\nAdvocates Rishi Bansal and Krisna Gambhir appeared for Burberry; no one appeared for the stall owner."}

A situation ought not to be created where the parent, who happens to have the physical custody of the minor child, uses the custody of such child as a tool to inflict suffering on the other parent, by depriving the other parent of contact with the minor child,\" the Bench said. \nThe Bench was hearing a father's habeas corpus plea seeking custody of his minor son, who was brought to India by his now estranged wife in February 2021. The father claimed that the wife brought his son to India without his consent. He even cited an order passed by a court in Arizona, United States of America (USA) which ordered shared custody of the child.\nThe wife had left Arizona in December 2020 and gone to Texas, where her brother lived. Then in February 2021, she returned to her hometown, Nagpur.\nThe Court noted that both the husband and the wife were financially sound and had married somewhere in 2014 and even jointly purchased a house in Phoenix, Arizona. It noted that the wife too was drawing a handsome salary. \n\"The couples in such cases are usually well educated and financially sound, as both are working individuals and there is no dearth of resources. Perhaps, it is the problem of plenty, which is leading to such frequent instances of one parent knocking the door of the Court, invoking the writ of habeas corpus to secure the custody of minor child or children, who are taken away by the other parent and brought to India. There is no dearth of intelligence and resources in the parties, but, there is lack of wisdom and maturity, thereby frequently bringing such cases to the writ court for decision,\" the judges observed.\nThe acrimony, bitterness and differences of opinion between the parents ought not to lead to a situation where the minor child becomes a mere pawn, to be exploited by one parent against the other, the Court added.\nTherefore, the Bench ordered the wife to implement the orders passed by the court at Arizona, which has ordered shared custody of the child. \nIt further clarified if the wife does not wish to travel to USA, then the husband will have to ensure he grants virtual access of the child to the mother every alternate day, for at least 40 minutes on video call. \nAdvocates Prabhjit Jauhar, Tulika Bhatnagar and Ayushi Dangre, appeared for the petitioner husband. \nSenior Advocate SK Mishra, along with Advocates Ayush Sharma and Virat Mishra represented the respondent wife. \nAdditional Government Pleader SS Doifode appeared for the State."}

In 2018, he called her to his home to work on a project. He and his wife persuaded her to stay in a room in their home and he sexually assaulted her. They removed her clothes, took explicit photographs of her, and threatened her to not tell anybody about the incident.\nSubsequently, he subjected her to further sexual assault. He demanded money from her on the threat of showing her photographs to other people, forcing her to steal Rs.10,000 from her family to give to him. A complaint against them was lodged in 2021, after which the respondent and his wife were both arrested. The respondent applied for bail, which was granted by the trial court within two days of his arrest.\nThe Counsel for the petitioner argued that the trial court’s order granting bail was illegal and perverse as it overlooked the severity of the act, how the incident took place and did not consider the allegations which constitute a prima facie case against the accused. \nMoreover, the incident took place when the victim was below 16 years, which makes it mandatory for the Court to issue notice to the complainant or the victim. The trial court granted bail to the accused in a hurried manner, without giving an opportunity to the victim to come before the Court. \nThe respondent's counsel pointed out that the alleged sexual assault took place in 2018, while the victim disclosed the incident 2 and a half years later, without any explanation for the delay. Referring to the judgement of the apex court in Myakala Dharmarajam and Ors. v. State of Telangana and Anr, he argued that there is a difference between rejection and cancellation of bail; cancellation of bail is a harsh order as it interferes with the liberty of a person and must not be lightly resorted to.\nThe Court noted that while the trial court had give a number of reasons for granting bail, the law mandates that when the victim is below the age of 16 years, an opportunity has to be given before passing the order to the victim/complainant/informant. \nThe same has not been done in the instant case, the Court noted.\nIn the case on hand, the said mandatory provision of opportunity is not given to the victim and the order has been passed within two days…”\nWhile the Public Prosecutor and the counsel for the accused were given an opportunity to be heard, no such opportunity was given to the victim/complainant. \nThe Court did not accept the argument that the provision did not have to be complied with as the victim was 17 years old on the date of lodging the complaint, observing that the Court has to take note of the age of the minor girl on the date of the offence, and not on the date of the complaint. \nHence, the Court ordered that the bail order be set aside and the accused be arrested and sent to custody. \nAdvocate Sachin BS appeared on behalf of the petitioner, and advocate Chandrashekhar RP appeared for the respondent."}

The resolution plan offered them an amount of ₹52 Crores. However, they challenged the order of the AA approving the said plan.\nThe limited question before the NCLAT was whether the appellant workmen were entitled to get a copy of the resolution plan or any part of the proceedings whose approval they had challenged and if the resolution plan, after being approved by the AA, still continues to be a confidential document, so as to deny access to any of the claimants.\nAfter considering the arguments from both sides, the NCLAT held that though the resolution plan is a confidential document during the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) and entitlement to its copy during this process is only for those who participate in it, but the documents cease to be confidential once the plan has been approved by the AA.\nReferring to Rule 14 of the NCLT Rules, 2016 (which deals with inspection of records), the NCLAT said that when a plan is submitted to the AA with an application to accept it, the application as well as the plan is on record and then the right to inspection is granted statutorily.\n“When Resolution Plan is submitted to the Adjudicating Authority with an Application to accept the Plan, the Application as well as Plan is on the record of the case or proceeding and then right to inspection is granted statutorily, we do not accept the submission of learned Counsel for the Respondents that Resolution Plan still remains confidential documents after it is made part of the record or proceeding of the Adjudicating Authority… When inspection is permitted of record of the Adjudicating Authority, obviously inspection can very well be made of the Resolution Plan, which is part of the proceedings before the Adjudicating Authority. Section 117 of the NCLT Rules, 2016 deals with ‘Mode of inspection’. Sub-rule (3) of Rule 117 provides that note of any record can also be taken in pencil by a person inspecting the record,” the NCLAT said.\nIt also referred to the fact that once the plan is approved, the records of the plan are sent to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Board) to be recorded in its database and the fact sub-clause (h) of sub-section (1) of Section 196 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code empowers the Board to call for any information and records from the insolvency agencies, professionals and information utilities, indicates that the plan is no longer confidential. \n“The power of the Board is thus also to call for any record from the Insolvency Professional, which may also include the Resolution Plan. Sub-clause (k) further empowers the Board to collect and maintain records relating to insolvency and bankruptcy cases and disseminate information relating to such cases. We, thus, are of the view that sending of the records by the Resolution Professional to Board as contemplated by Section 31 sub-section (3) is not only for proper data research studies only and the records and information can be recorded in its database and also can be published. The above scheme of the Code also indicates that after Resolution Plan is submitted to the Adjudicating Authority and it is approved by the Adjudicating Authority, it no longer remains a confidential document, so as to preclude Regulator and other persons from access the said document,” the judgment said. \nThe bench further cited Section 61, sub-section (3) of the IBC which deals with the grounds on which an appeal can be filed against the order approving the resolution plan. \nIt asked as to how an appellant will satisfy the appellate court that grounds enumerated in the said section are made out if they are not even aware of the contents of the resolution plan.\n“The provision of Section 61, sub-section (3) reaffirms our view that after approval of the Resolution Plan, Resolution Plan does not remain a confidential document, so as to deny its perusal to a claimant, who is aggrieved by the Plan and has come up on the Appeal. We, thus, are of the view that Resolution Plan after its approval by the Adjudicating Authority is no more a confidential document, so as to deny access to even a claimant.”\nThe NCLAT, however, noted that in the present case there are more than 20,000 operational creditors and several applicants had approached the AA for a copy of the resolution plan which was rejected by the order of February 2021.\nThe bench said that though the entire resolution plan cannot be supplied to the appellant, they are entitled to the party of the plan which relates to workmen and employees. Therefore, it directed the respondent to provide the relevant portion of the plan to the appellants within three weeks.\nThe petitioners were represented by Senior Advocate Nikhil Nayyar, along with advocates S Manjula Devi, and KS Ravichandran (CS).\nRespondents 1 and 3 were represented by Senior Advocate Arun Kathpalia, along with advocates Malhar Zatakia, Nishant Upadhyay, Madhur Arora, Dhiraj Kumar Totala and Tanya Chib.\nRespondent 2 was represented by advocates Isha Malik, Niharika Shukla and Raunak Dhillon appeared for R-2.\nRespondent 4 was represented advocates Pooja Mahajan, Aashish Vats, Arveera Sharma, and Mahima Singh."}

Union of India & Anr].\nAt a special sitting held on Sunday, a division bench of Justices GS Kulkarni and Neela Gokhale said that PIL was a publicity oriented petition and that the consistent stand of courts when it comes to declaration of holidays is that the same is within the policy realm of the government.\n\"A consistent view has been taken by the Supreme Court and by various High Courts that a decision to declare or not to declare a holiday falls within the realm of the executive policy,\" the Court ruled.\nFurther, courts have frequently held that such exercise of power by the State is not arbitrary but in consonance with the secular principles, the bench underscored.\n\"Moreover such decision is taken by the executive in fostering the sentiments as enshrined in the Constitution and in recognition of the secular principles when a holiday is being declared on any religious occasion. We are therefore, of the considered view that the petitioners have miserably failed to make out a case of any arbitrariness, in the impugned decision of the State Government,\" the bench held.\nPertinently, the Court said that the petition was not supported by adequate material.\nThe Court also castigated the petitioners for what it termed as questioning the wisdom of the Supreme Court in the Ayodhay title suit judgment of 2019. \n\"The petitioners have not left a single stone unturned, when in paragraph 21 of the petition statements are made, even questioning the wisdom of the Supreme Court in deciding the case in respect of which the petitioners raise concern. Our judicial conscience is in fact shocked at such approach of the petitioners. If this is the understanding of law of these petitioners, in making such statements on the decision of the Supreme Court with a further overtone of a motive being attributed to the decision of the Supreme Court, such approach of the petitioners can be said to be far from being bonafide. In fact, no prudent litigant would make such a statement which is against the basic tenets of what Article 141 of the Constitution would mandate,\" the Court stated in its order.\nIt appears to be a petition that is politically motivated and publicity interest litigation and a glare for publicity seems to be apparent from the tenor of the petition and the arguments made in open court, the bench said.\n\"It is difficult for us to believe that these law students would inculcate imagination at such stage of their life and even before entering this noble profession, make such serious statements which are against the constitutional ethos. We have no manner of doubt that this petition is utterly motivated and is filed on extraneous considerations. As rightly contended on behalf of the respondents, the petition is patently frivolous which is undeserving of any attention of the Court,\" the order stated.\nThe Court also noted that though the petitioners were challenging a Central government notification of 1968 which delegates powers to States to declare such holidays, the said notification was not appended to the petition.\n\"By the notification, the government has declared January 22 as a public holiday in Maharashtra on occasion of Ram Mandir Pran Partisthan Din. At the outset, we can observe that the notification of May 1968 issued by Home Affairs is challenged and the same is not on record. This notification confers power on State government (to declare holiday),\" the Court said.\nIt cautioned the petitioners against pursuing such issues by way of PIL but refrained from imposing costs.\n\"We intend to caution the petitioners to be more careful and circumspect when they take upon themselves espousing such causes. For the aforesaid reasons, we have no manner of doubt that the present proceeding is a patent abuse of process of law.

However, considering that the petitioners are students and the caution we have sounded to the petitioners, we refrain from imposing cost with a hope that the petitioners shall be more careful in future,\" the bench said while dismissing the plea.\nThe petition was filed by four law students, Shivangi Agarwal, Satyajeet Salve, Vedant Agrawal, Khushi Bangia, pursuing LL.B from Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU), Government Law College(GLC), Mumbai and NIRMA Law University, Gujarat.\nThey sought quashing of the notification issued by the Maharashtra government on January 19.\nAs per the plea, the State government notification amounted to expending from the government exchequer for religious purpose which is prohibited under the Constitution.\nPertinently, the plea said that India is a secular State and the government cannot identify itself with any particular religion. \nThe consecration of a temple is an essential religious practice associated with Hindu religion and cannot be in any manner a concern of the government.\n\"Any steps taken by the government including declaration of public holiday for celebrating the consecration of a Hindu temple is nothing but an act of identifying with a particular religion,\" the plea said.\nThe petitioners further emphasized that such public holidays would lead to loss of education, financial loss and loss of governance and public work, since schools, banks and government offices would be closed.\n\"In the absence of legislation conferring power to declare a public holiday on the State governments and without there being guidelines which are secular in nature, such declarations to appease a majority community that too for political purposes would be a sheer abuse of power and would destroy secular fabric of India,\" the petition underscored.\nThe petitioners also challenged the notification of 1968 issued by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs that empowers State to exercise powers under the Negotiable Instruments Act to declare public holidays.\nThe plea said that the said power under the Negotiable Instruments Act is vested with the Central government and it could not have been delegated to States.\n\"A bare perusal of Section 25 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 makes it clear that it intended to bestow the power to declare the public holidays with the Central government. The language used in the explanation to section 25 is rather clear and does not have any ambiguity...Thus, such an express power of the Central government could not have been delegated in favour of the State government,\" it was submitted.\nWhen the matter was taken up for hearing today, the Court noted that though the petitioners were challenging the notification issued by the Central government in 1968, the same was not annexed to the petition.\n\"You cannot refer to the notification pertaining to Union Territories. It is issued in the independent power under Article 329. You have to refer to the one that gives powers to state government. Your prayer is challenging the notification when the 1968 notification is not on record. How can you challenge it without enclosing it?\" the Court asked.\n\"Even if there is no notification, the Act itself does not provide power to State government and State cannot declare holiday,\" one of the petitioners Shivangi Agarwal submitted.\n\"If the notification is challenged on understanding of a notification which is not on record then they can file a fresh petition. This notification has been on record for 25 years, all States have it. But if there are enthusiastic then they can file a fresh petition,\" Advocate General (AG) Birendra Saraf submitted on behalf of the State government.\nOn the merits of the declaration of holiday by the State, the Advocate General said that it is a policy decision which cannot be subject to judicial scrutiny.\n\"So far as 2024 declaration of holiday is concerned, that is something which falls within the executive policy decision. That is something which does not fall within judicial scrutiny. Challenge is on the ground that it is arbitrary. On what grounds they say arbitrary, that it is for a particular event. The consecration event is an essential religious practice. Once this is acknowledged, it cannot be arbitrary,\" he said.\nThe AG further contended that the petition clearly state on what ground the notification was arbitrary, \nHe further argued that declaring a holiday for a religious practice or ceremony is not arbitrary and does not affect the secular fabric of the country.\n\"Allowing religious practice cannot be said to be in way of secularism, in fact it is far from that. Because state has from time to time been doing it for various religious practices. Merely declaring holiday for essential practice is arbitrary is incorrect proposition....The secular fibre of this country is not fragile and they are known to have celebrated many occasion and this is an occasion where people want to celebrate. But this declaring of holiday is not arbitrary or unconstitutional,\" the AG said.\nAdditional Solicitor General Devang Vyas, who appeared on behalf of Central government, said that since the petitioners have not appended the 1968 notification, it would not be necessary for him to argue the matter.\n\"There are not challenging 1968 notification. So nothing is left for me (to argue). But as a student, why would you object you to a holiday,\" he said in lighter vein.\nIn response to the State's argument that government can declare holidays for religious events, the petitioners submitted that State can declare holidays for major religious festivals but not religious ceremonies.\n\"Holidays are for festivals. This is a mere ceremony,\" it was contended on behalf of the petitioners.\nThe Court also questioned the petitioners about how the plea came to be reported by the media before the hearing.\n\"There is an argument that this is politically motivated petition. How is it that before we could read, the contents of the petition are in media,\" the bench said.\n\"We have no idea about this. We were in court from afternoon for circulation. We do not know about that,\" the petitioner said.\nIn another special hearing held on Sunday, the Madras High Court dismissed a PIL petition against the decision to give half-day holiday to Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education & Research (JIPMER), Pondicherry on January 22."}

The Act is meant to provide for the rights of women to secure housing,” the Court said. \nThe parties began their relationship in 2009, while they were both married to their respective spouses. The woman divorced her husband in 2014 and married the petitioner. The petitioner claimed that his wife was on dialysis and would not survive for long, so he began living with the respondent woman. \nIt was submitted by the respondent that the petitioner was listed as the father of her child in school records and was shown as a nominee in her bank accounts thereby establishing a domestic relationship between the two. \nAfter residing together for six years, in 2020, disputes arose between the parties.\nThe woman filed an application under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 seeking interim maintenance. \nShe also filed a complaint and sought an order restraining the petitioner from evicting her from the rented accommodation.\nThe Metropolitan Magistrate by an order dated August 17, 2020 restrained the petitioner from dispossessing the woman of the house. \nBy another order dated October 26, 2020, Metropolitan Magistrate directed the petitioner to pay an ad-interim maintenance of Rs.10,000 per month.\nAppeal by the petitioner against the said orders were dismissed by the Additional Sessions Judge leading to the present plea before the High Court. \nThe petitioner argued that the application filed by the woman was not maintainable since no domestic relationship persisted between the parties as the woman knew that the etitioner was married.\nHowever, the Court rejected this argument stating that the couple had proclaimed to the world at large that they are both husband and wife by way of the marriage deed and cohabiting for several years,\n“The documents placed before this Court shows that the couple has held themselves out in the society as being akin to spouses which fact is evident from the marriage-cum-agreement deed, affidavits, the school records of the child and the bank statements of the respondent.

We do not appreciate the High Court passing an order as a counterblast to our order. Thank you for bringing it to our notice, but are you supporting? What is happening in Gujarat High Court?” Justice Nagarathna asked the State counsel.\n“In a disposed of matter, it (High Court) passed again? How?” Justice Bhuyan asked.\n“No court in India can pass an order like this on a Saturday against a superior court order. Without giving notice to the other side,” Justice Nagarathna added.\nJustice Bhuyan further weighed in that the single judge’s Saturday order was “completely against settled orders” of the Supreme Court.\n“There was no need for the High Court to justify,” Justice Nagarathna commented.\n “Yes. It is against the Constitutional philosophy. How can you perpetuate an unjust condition on the victim?” Justice Bhuyan further asked.\nAppearing for the Gujarat government, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta replied that there was a clerical error warranting the passage of a second order in the case by the High Court. \n\"My lords may leave it at that. There was a misunderstanding,\" he added.\nThe Supreme Court, however, remained unconvinced.\n\"No misunderstanding. Why was the order passed?\", the Court asked.\n\"This was a speaking to minutes matter,\" the Solicitor General started to explain.\n\"On a Saturday?\" the Court questioned further.\n \"Please treat it as withdrawn,\" the Solicitor General requested the Court.\n\"How can we withdraw a High Court order?\" the Court remarked, while going on to note that the second order appeared to have been passed suo motu.\n\"No judge can pass an order as a counterblast to our order.

Kindly do not say anything. We as government can ask the judge to recall the order ... Kindly ignore the High Court order. It will really have a bad effect, demoralising. Otherwise a very good judge,\" Mehta submitted.\nThe bench responded that it is not on any particular judge.\nThe rape survivor's counsel, Senior Advocate Sanjay Parikh, meanwhile, added that the High Court hearing may be in the public domain since the Gujarat High Court live-streams its proceedings on YouTube.\nThe Court, however, ultimately refrained from recording any adverse observations against the High Court in its order allowing the abortion plea.\nThe case involved allegations of rape on the pretext of marriage.\nThe Supreme Court held that the High Court's order to reject the plea by the rape survivor for a medical termination of pregnancy was ex facie contradictory.\nThe top court also observed that in Indian society, while pregnancy may be a source of joy for a married couple, it affects the mental health of the woman when such a pregnancy is unwanted and outside a marriage.\nThe bench further reiterated that a woman has a sacrosanct right to bodily integrity.\n\"In the context of abortion, the right of dignity entails recognising the competence and authority of every woman to take reproductive decisions, including the decision to terminate the pregnancy. Although human dignity inheres in every individual, it is susceptible to violation by external conditions and treatment imposed by the State. The right of every woman to make reproductive choices without undue interference from the state is central to the idea of human dignity. Deprivation of access to reproductive healthcare or emotional and physical well-being also injures the dignity of women.\"\nHence, it allowed the plea to terminate the pregnancy.\nIf the foetus is found to be alive following the medical procedure, the hospital is to extend all facilities to incubate the foetus and ensure the survival of the foetus, the Court added.\nThe State shall then take steps to ensure that the child is adopted in accordance with law, the Court ordered.\n\"At this stage, we restrain ourselves from observing anything on the order passed by the learned Single Judge of the High Court in a disposed of matter on 19.08.2023 pursuant to the order passed by us on the said date though we have to say that it was highly improper,\" the Supreme Court added.\nThe bench further directed that the State should take steps to preserve tissues of the foetus if it is possible so that it may be handed over to the investigating agency for DNA examination in the rape case filed by the woman in the matter."}

It is further held and observed that inequality of men in different groups excludes applicability of the principle of ‘equal pay for equal work’ to them,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court was hearing an appeal filed by Central government challenging a decision of the Gauhati High Court which had allowed the plea of certain nursing assistants (respondents before Supreme Court), working at various hospitals under the establishment of Border Security Force.\nThe High Court had ruled that the nursing assistants are entitled to nursing allowance which was being given to the staff nurses at the hospital.\nThe High Court had observed that mere difference of educational qualification cannot be a ground for denial of nursing allowance to the present respondents since the duties performed by them were similar to the duties performed by staff nurses.\nAggrieved by the decision of the High Court, the Central government moved the apex court.\nBefore the Supreme Court, the government argued that since the educational qualification of the nursing assistants and the staff nurses are different, the nursing assistants cannot claim nursing allowance at par with the staff nurses.\nIt was further stated that the nursing assistants do not possess the relevant qualification and experience as mandated to receive nursing allowance at par with the staff nurses since they do not have any registration certificate issued by the State Nursing Council and the Indian Nursing Council unlike the staff nurses.\nThe appellants further contended that the classification of the different pay scales is permissible based upon educational qualifications, experience and nature of duties and therefore, the High Court materially erred in ruling in favor of the respondents.\nOn the other hand, the respondents argued that since the nursing assistants are an integral part of the nursing alongside staff nurses and perform similar duties, the High Court was right in observing and taking the view that the nursing assistants are also entitled to get the nursing allowance similar to the staff nurses.\nThe Supreme Court noted that the short question for consideration before it was whether nursing assistants be entitled to the nursing allowance at par with the staff nurses even if the educational qualifications for the post of nursing assistant and staff nurse are different. \nAnswering the question in negative, the Court observed that the same is already covered by its decisions in Punjab State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited and Another v.

Therefore, the case of nursing assistants cannot be compared with that of the staff nurses as both carry different educational qualification. Under the circumstances, the High Court has committed a serious error in holding and directing that the nursing assistants serving in the Assam Rifles/BSF are entitled to nursing allowance at par with the staff nurses.\"\nTherefore, the appeal was allowed."}

State of Maharashtra & Anr.]\nThe case led Justice Bharati Dangre to take critical note of how the judges as well as special prosecutors appointed under the POCSO Act often commit gross errors leading to miscarriage of justice.\n\"The State and the Special Public Prosecutor continue to act mute spectators to the flawed implementation of the legislation, which is specifically intended to protect the children from commission of serious offences of sexual assault, which are considered to be heinous in nature and a need was felt for the special statute, as the provisions in the IPC were found to be inadequate to tackle this menace,\" the High Court said. \nIt, therefore, directed the principal secretary of the State's law and judiciary department to state on affidavit what steps should be taken if prosecutors do not notice gross errors in implementing the POCSO Act.\n“The affidavit shall also specifically state what the State Department intends to do, once this glaring aspect is brought to its notice. The public prosecutor (of the High Court) shall place the necessary material before the Principal Secretary, Law and Judiciary Department, who shall file his affidavit within a period of two weeks from today,” the Court ordered.\nThe Court also directed the principal secretary to suggest a mechanism to create awareness about the POCSO Act, considering that even the investigating agency had failed to invoke the correct provisions in the present case. \nThe convict in the present case was a 64-year-old man, who was found guilty of having attempted to rape a 10-year-old. \nThe trial court had imposed a 3-year rigorous imprisonment sentence by invoking Section 18 of the POCSO Act (attempt to commit offence) read with Sections 4 and 6 (which deal with sexual assault and penetrative sexual assault).\nSection 18 says that for attempts to commit an offence, the punishment imposed can be half of the punishment of imprisonment for life or one half of the longest sentence prescribed for the main offence.\nWhile so, the High Court was perplexed about why the trial court judge only imposed a 3 year sentence, when the punishments for the main offences under Sections 4 and 6 were 7 years and 10 years respectively, at minimum, and life imprisonment at most. \n“It is not open to a court to impose a punishment lesser than the minimum that is prescribed and the only discretion vest is between the lesser punishment and the maximum punishment. If Section 18 contemplates imprisonment for life, as the longest punishment, then in no case, the punishment could have been restricted to 3 years of rigorous imprisonment” the High Court observed. \nThe Court proceeded to question what steps could be taken against prosecutors and judges for failing to notice such the errors while implementing the POCSO Act.\n“Not only the judges but even the special prosecutors are expected to be cognizant of the provisions of the POCSO Act and the question that arises is, in such a case of miscarriage of justice, who is to be blamed?” the High Court lamented.\nThe Court indicated that it would pass appropriate directions to fix more accountability on POCSO judges, once it receives the affidavit from the State government on this issue. \nAdvocate Samay Pawar along with advocate Ramnik P Pawar appeared for the appellant (accused) in this case. \nAdditional Public Prosecutor YM Nakhwa, APP represented the State.\nAdvocate Abbas Z Mookhtiar represented the complainant."}
{"id": "id_431", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the Central government to allow Permanent Commission (PC) to women officers who were excluded from the same on the ground of unequal application of fitness standards. \nThe Court in its judgment noted that the fitness standards, known as Shape 1 criteria, were applicable to male officers at the time when they were granted Permanent Commission in the early years of service. \nHowever, the aggrieved women officers before the Supreme Court were granted PC only last year pursuant to Supreme Court's landmark judgment in Secretary Ministry of Defence v. Babita Puniya and were therefore senior in age. \nTherefore, applying the Shape 1 Fitness rule to them now would be arbitrary. \n\"Superficial face of equality will not be in consonance with the principles enshrined in the Constitution,\" the Court said. \nThe Court said that while Shape 1 criteria itself is not arbitrary, there was discrimination in its application. \n\"Army says medical category has been applied by taking age related factors into account. However, discrimination and exclusion is there in this application. Similarly aged male PC officers do not have to maintain SHAPE 1 Fitness now when granted PC earlier,\" the Court observed.\nIt, therefore, ruled that women officers who were excluded from PC in November 2020 based on non-compliance with Shape 1 Fitness standards are entitled to continue as permanent commissioned force till they fulfil the fitness criteria needed for continuance in service.\nThe Court turned down the argument of the Central government that such additional standards were set since the usual upper limit of 250 Permanent Commissions a year was not followed this time in view of the Supreme Court's landmark judgment in Babita Puniya.\n\"Applying this ceiling is to bypass the route for women officers. Process by which women SSC officers were considered for PC was based on belated application of the Babita Puniya verdict. Finest women officers have been ignored on the specious grounds that their awards and merit was on 5th and 10th year of service,\" the Court noted.\nThe Court further said that the evaluation process which has been followed in the case of Women Short Service Commission Officers (WSSCO) clearly ignored that the writing of their Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs) was fundamentally \"influenced by the circumstance that at the relevant time an option of PC was not available for women\". \nEven as late as October 2020, the authorities have emphasized the need to duly fill in a recommendation on whether or not WSSCOs should be granted PC, the Court added. \nThe Court further held that societal structures have been \"created by males for males\".\n\"Some look harmless but it's a patriarchal reflection of our society. It is not correct to say that women serve in the Army when the real picture is different. Superficial face of Equality does not stand true to the principles enshrined in the Constitution,\" the judgment stated. \nA formalistic application of pre-existing policies while granting PC is a continuation of these systemic discriminatory practices, it observed. \nIn a landmark verdict in February last year, the Supreme Court had directed that women officers in the Army be granted Permanent Commission on par with their male counterparts. \nThe Court had, in the process, held that the Centre's stance was based on gender stereotypes and societal notions on gender roles that men are physically stronger while women are weak and submissive.\nThe Court had found that those arguments were disturbing, apart from being contrary to Central government's own 2019 policy.\nIt had, therefore, directed the Central government to implement the Court's ruling within three months. \nHowever, sixty women officers alleged that they were denied Permanent Commission in the Army on the ground of failure to adhere to SHAPE - I fitness and had moved the top court.\nDuring the hearing, the Bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and MR Shah had questioned the Army for denying Permanent Commission to the petitioners by requiring them to have the same fitness standards which are mandated for 25-year-old male officers. The Court said there cannot be a “perverse inequality” in the Armed Forces.\nAdditional Solicitor General Sanjay Jain, appearing for the Ministry of Defence, had told the Court that the Centre applied the same rules to male officers as well. \nHe added that the Centre’s intentions were not mala fide. \n“We have applied those tests which meet the standards of objectivity and include the maximum possible people, and have kept within the realm of our policy in doing so,\" he argued. \nHe had also contended that though the normal rule is that not more than 250 officers can be granted Permanent Commission in a year, there was no such vacancy benchmark for this year in view of Supreme Court's judgment in Babita Puniya. This, he said was the reason for setting a medical benchmark. \nThe top court has now ordered that army must remove the requirement of benchmarking the WSSCOs with the last male officer who had received PC in their corresponding batches and all WSSCOs meeting the 60% cut-off must be granted PC.\nJustice Chandrachud, while hearing an unrelated case, had recently remarked that it was satisfying to have 422 women getting Permanent Commission pursuant to the February verdict."}

Nothing has been brought on record to show that during this period of 21 months, when the petitioner has been a free man, he has indulged in any unlawful activity. On the contrary, the petitioner got elected to the Legislative Assembly in the year 2021 and he is now a sitting member of the Assembly.\"\nThe apex court had, on March 20 this year, reserved its verdict on the appeal by the Assamese peasant leader against the High Court order. \nThe bench had in February sought the response of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the matter.\nThe notice issued was limited to the aspect of whether Gogoi can be released on bail till the trial is over.\nSenior Advocate Huzefa Ahmadi, appearing for Gogoi, had argued that there were no allegations of the leader abusing his liberties while out on bail post the discharge order.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the NIA, then said that the CPI (Maoist), to which Gogoi allegedly sent cadre for warfare training, has never been a political party.\nAdditional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati, assisted by advocate Kanu Agrawal, said that the charges under the UAPA were not with regard to peaceful bandhs or shutdowns, but for the far graver offence of using terrorist methods and waging war against an elected government. \nGogoi and three others were booked for the offences in relation to December 2019 protests and speeches against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and alleged links to Maoist organisations.\nThey were charged under various provisions of Unlawful Prevention Activities Act (UAPA) and for Sedition (section 124A), promoting enmity between religious groups (section 153A) and 153B (Statement against national integration) under the Indian Penal Code.\nThe special NIA court in Guwahati had in July 2021 discharged Gogoi of all the charges against him.\nThe special court had gone on to the extent of stating that the speeches made by Gogoi far from inciting violence, in fact exhorted people not to resort to violence.\nThe special court had underscored that temporary blockades/protests without incitement to violence would not constitute a terrorist act under Section 15 of UAPA.\nThe High Court had, however, overturned this verdict on February 9 this year, stating that the special Court had 'travelled way beyond the level of sifting of evidence' permissible at the stage of framing charges, and its order read like that of an acquittal than discharge.\nIt had, therefore, remitted the matter back to the special court for fresh consideration on framing of charges, leading to the present appeal before the top court.\nThe top court in its judgment noted that no purpose will be served in allowing the special NIA court to remand Gogoi to custody."}

In my view, the tone and tenor of the incendiary speech tend to have a debilitating effect upon public tranquility, peace and harmony of the society,\" the Court said.\nThe fundamental right of free speech and expression is placed at a high pedestal by our Constitution, but it cannot be cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony of the society, the Court underscored while denying him bail.\nAfter examining the relevant portion of his alleged speech, the Court noted that the fundamental right of ‘freedom of speech and expression’ as enshrined under Article 19 has been placed on a very high pedestal in constitution of this country.\nInterestingly the judge said that the essence of freedom of speech has been well captured by famous British poet and intellectual John Milton.\n\"Give me the liberty to know, to argue freely, and to utter according to conscience, above all liberties,” the Court quoted Milton.\nThe order also quoted Swami Vivekananda as saying, \"We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary. Thoughts live; they travel far.\" \nThe Court, however, observed that the same Constitution places reasonable restrictions upon exercise of the right, among other things, on the grounds of public order and incitement to an offence.\n“That apart, article 51A(e) of the Constitution also casts a fundamental duty upon citizens of this country to promote harmony and spread common brotherhood amongst all the people of India, transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities. Therefore, it is no gainsaying that fundamental right of ‘freedom of speech and expression’ cannot be exercised at the cost of communal peace and harmony of the society,” it added.\nAs far as the question of Imam’s purported speech being seditious goes, the Court felt it required a “deeper analysis” at an appropriate stage.\nBut on a cursory and plain reading of his speech of December 13, 2019, it felt that it was “clearly on communal/divisive lines”.\n“I am not inclined to grant bail to applicant/accused Sharjeel Imam at this stage. The accused cannot claim any parity with co-accused as his role is entirely different from other co-accused. Accordingly, the instant application moved on behalf of applicant/accused Sharjeel Imam for grant of regular bail stands dismissed,” it was held.\nEarlier, the Court prima facie noted the evidence in support of the allegations with regards to the rioters being instigated by Imam’s speech of December 13, 2019 giving rise to rioting, mischief, attacking the police party etc to be “scanty and sketchy”.\n“Neither any eye witness has been cited by prosecution nor there is any other evidence on record to suggest that co-accused got instigated and committed the alleged act of rioting etc upon hearing the speech of applicant/accused Sharjeel Imam,” the order stated.\nFurther, there was no evidence corroborating the version of prosecution that alleged rioters were a part of the audience addressed by Imam on the same day.\nThe Special Public Prosecutor also fairly conceded that at the present, there was no material available with the prosecution to show that Imam and other co-accused persons were members of any common social platform to fasten them with the aid of abetment.\n“The essential link between the speech dated 13.12.2019 and the subsequent acts of co-accused is conspicuously missing in the instant case,” the order highlighted.\nAccordingly, the Court underscored that the theory of the investigating agency had left “gaping holes” as regards rioting, mischief and attacking police thereby portraying an “incomplete picture” and the gaps were filled by resorting to “surmises and conjectures” or by essentially relying upon the disclosure statements of Iman and the co-accused.\n“In either case, it is not legally permissible to build the edifice of prosecution version upon the foundation of imagination or upon inadmissible confession before a police officer. Once the legally impermissible foundation of imaginative thinking and disclosure statement of accused/co-accused is removed, the prosecution version on this count appears to be crumbling like a house of cards,” it noted.\nHowever, the Court said there was sufficient grounds to deny him bail for offences of sedition under Section 124A IPC and for promoting enmity between religious groups under Section 153A. \nImam was accused of giving provocative speeches on December 13 and 15 in 2019 and January 16, 2020. It is the prosecution case that the speeches culminated in riots at several places. The present case dealt with speech on December 13, 2019 where he was alleged to have been seen instigating a particular religious community against the government by creating unfounded fears in their minds regarding Citizenship Amendment Bill (at the relevant time) and National Register of Citizens. \nHe was accordingly chargesheeted under Sections 124A (sedition) and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code.\nImam is also facing cases pertaining to northeast Delhi violence of February, 2020, and is currently in jail."}

They also argued that the prosecution introduced new witnesses and filed their affidavits before SSP, Meerut, which was not admissible in law.\nThey stated that Chandra Mohan, a godman, was responsible for lodging the FIRs against the revolting disciples of ‘Janeu Kranti Abhiyan’ and that there were several FIRs against him. \nIt was also claimed that the accused were associated with Chandra Mohan and used to live permanently with him since 2018 but, after some time, they realized that they had been cheated by him and came to know of his illegal activities. As a result, they posted several messages on a WhatsApp group, which led to protests against Chandra Mohan and divided his disciples into two sections.\nThe counsel further argued that the survivor, who was the National President of ‘Janeu Kranti Abhiyan’ could have lodged the FIR at Varanasi itself, and lodging the FIR at a far place like Meerut, that too after over a month, indicated malicious intent. \nOn the other hand, the State vehemently opposed the bail applications on the grounds that the accused had committed a gruesome act with the survivor, and it was not possible for a woman to falsely accuse someone of rape in Indian society. \nThey also argued that sexual assault often goes unreported and that the prosecution witnesses have deposed against the accused.

The Bench said the same should be done across States and agencies.\n\"...we are of the view that all prosecuting agencies/State Governments/UTs should issue such directions to the Public Prosecutors so that neither in pleadings nor in arguments, is a stand taken contrary to the legal position enunciated by this Court. The circulation in this behalf should be made through the Director of Prosecution and training programmes be organized to keep on updating the Prosecutors in this behalf,\" the Court ordered.\nNext on the Court's agenda was the disproportionately large number of undertrials in some states. To address this issue, it asked counsel for Tamil Nadu, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha to take special steps in coordination with legal service authorities to deal with the large number of undertrial prisoners in those states. It also noted,\n\"Insofar as the Madras High Court is concerned, none has even cared to attend the proceedings. Let the Registrar remain personally present in Court as even the arrangement for representation has not been made.\"\nThe Bench took note of a judgment passed on Monday by the top court where it was stated that the legality of trial courts passing remand orders the moment an accused is to appear, needs to be examined in an appropriate case.\n\"...this case itself is the appropriate case as directions have already been passed and somehow they have been understood as if they will apply to cases for regular bail and not to anticipatory bail. We would like to clarify that what we have enunciated qua bail would equally apply to anticipatory bail cases. Anticipatory bail after all is one of the species of a bail,\" the order noted.\nThe Court also directed the states that had not issued formal standing orders regarding compliance of the judgments to do so within three weeks, failing which their Home Secretaries shall personally remain present in court.\nThe Supreme Court had in February lamented the delay by four High Courts, the CBI and most states in filing status reports in this case.\nIn that hearing, Senior Advocate Sidharth Luthra, who is now formally the Amicus Curiae in the matter, had pointed out that several cases of non-compliance of the top court's order in Siddharth v State of Uttar Pradesh have occured.\nThis judgment had made it clear that trial courts cannot insist that accused are remanded to custody before they take cognisance of the chargesheet.\nThe Bench had then said that the affidavits by High Courts should reflect if the same is being monitored.\nInterestingly, the top court had ordered that the judgments in Antil and Siddharth be made part of the curriculum of judicial academies.\nAdvocate Akbar Siddique is assisting the Amicus in the present case."}

{"id": "id_485", "reference_summary": "The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed University of Delhi (DU) to grant admission to a candidate belonging to the other backward classes (OBC) for the three-year LLM course despite the fact that the exams for first semester are already underway [Ashutosh Singh v University of Delhi].\nSingle-judge Justice Rekha Palli observed that she cannot lose sight of the fact that the purpose of reservation for OBC candidates is to encourage such students in fulfilling their dream to obtain higher education and therefore all authorities have a duty to take steps in furtherance of this constitutional goal of reservation.\n“I cannot also lose sight of the fact that the purpose of reservation for OBC candidates is to encourage such students to fulfil their dream to obtain higher education. All the authorities, therefore, have a duty to take such steps in furtherance of this constitutional goal of reservation for OBC candidates,” the Court said.\nThe Court was dealing with a petition filed by a student Ashutosh Singh whose candidature was rejected by DU in the spot admission round held on December 31, 2021 for the two-year/three-year LLM programme.\nThe Court was told that Singh had acquired the LLB degree from DU and had then applied for the LLM course in the OBC category. As per the admission bulletin, the students applying under the OBC category were required to furnish an OBC Non-Creamy Layer Certificate for the financial year 2021-22.\nThe bulletin, however, contained a provision enabling students in the OBC category, who were not in possession of the said certificate for the financial year 2021-22, to apply for admission by uploading either the earlier certificate or the acknowledgement slip of having applied for issuance of same for 2021-22, subject to their producing the requisite OBC-NCL certificate for 2021-22 at the time of admission.\nThe petitioner said that since he was already in possession of the 2018 certificate issued to him by the State of Uttar Pradesh, he submitted his application and uploaded a copy of the said certificate. He then appeared for the entrance test but his name did not appear in the three allotment lists issued by the university.\nOn December 30, 2021, the University informed the students about a fourth allotment list for spot admissions. The petitioners’ appeared in the fourth list.\nAt around 8:59 pm on December 31, a communication was sent by the DU that all the shortlisted candidates should upload all the requisite documents between 9 am and 1 pm on the same day and a payment link for the payment of fees after the verification of documents would be generated by 10 pm on the same day.\nAs he uploaded all his documents, he received another communication stating that his admission was not approved as the OBC Non-Creamy Layer certificate submitted by him did not pertain to the required financial year. Though the petitioner requested the university to grant him more time, the request was rejected on the ground that no opportunity for furnishing the documents at a later stage in the spot admission round could be granted.\nThe Court was informed that even today two seats in the OBC category are lying vacant.\nIn view of the above, Justice Palli held that even though DU may be justified in urging that since the admission process had to be finalised before December 31 and all the shortlisted candidates were required to produce their certificates at the time of admission, what was important was that the students were given only four hours to upload all their certificates. Besides, the fact that no undertaking will be accepted in this round was also brought to their knowledge only on the same day.\n“In their eagerness to complete the admission process by December 31, 2021, the respondent has just brushed this vital factor that the shortlisted students were granted only four hours to upload their documents and that too without having been earlier put to notice that no undertakings would be accepted,” the Court said. \nAt least some reasonable time ought to have been granted to the students like the petitioner to produce their documents especially when they had already applied for issuance of a renewed certificate, the single-judge opined. \n“In facts of the present case, the manner in which the respondent had given barely 4 hours to the students to upload all their documents and have let two precious seats reserved for OBC candidates go waste, I have no hesitation in holding that the action of the respondent in not approving the petitioner’s admission was arbitrary and wholly unsustainable,” the High Court ruled. \nThe Court further noted that though on the first blush, the university’s objection to grant any relief to the petition at this stage since the first semester exams have already started appears attractive. But when considering the fact that petitioner has been before the court since January and the matter had to be adjourned several times including for the reason that the adjournments were sought by the university’s counsel, the objection deserves to be rejected, Justice Palli said.\nIt, therefore, ordered that petitioner be granted admission into the three year LLM course and as for the exams of the first semester that are already underway, the petitioner will be permitted to appear in the same along with the exams for subsequent semesters as per the practice being followed by the University.\n“In case the petitioner is required to attend any additional classes, the respondent will issue appropriate instructions in this regard which the petitioner will be required to follow,” the judgment said. \nWhile advocates Raavi Kumar Jotwani, Nishant Kumar and Nitin Yadav appeared for the petitioner, DU was represented by advocates Mohinder JS Rupal and V Bhawani."}

{"id": "id_494", "reference_summary": "Chief Justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana on Tuesday highlighted the importance of bringing in a law to address the issue of fraudulent healthcare services that patients fall prey to. \nThe CJI was speaking at the inaugural National Academy of Medical Sciences' (NAMS, Delhi) public oration on ‘Law and Medicine’.\nTalking in the context of the rise of quackery in India, the CJI Ramana explained,\n\"Quackery begins where awareness ends. Where there is room for myths, there is room for quackery. Quackery is the biggest disease affecting India. Owing to the financial and time constraints, a huge majority of Indian population approaches these untrained and uncertified doctors. Lack of awareness and knowledge, misplaced belief, and sheer inaccessibility has massive ramifications on the health of the country, particularly the rural and under-privileged India. Need of the hour is to bring in a legislation to save people from falling prey to fraudulent practices in the name of treatment.\"\nThe CJI said that he would speak about certain aspects of the medical education system in the country after his retirement.\nIn his speech, the CJI said that the practice of medicine was the bridge between science and technology, and the human mind and body.\n\"Doctors express this scientific understanding day in and day out through their medical practice. There are very few professions that exist in a constant state of flux in the way the medical profession does. In fact, the medical profession is most reflective of technological and the scientific developments. It is sensitive to every advancement in technology and is constantly striving to improve the care and services it offers.\"\nHe also touched upon the significance of safeguarding the health of citizens, which he said the Constitution-makers laid great emphasis on.\n\"Our courts also have played significant role in realizing these goals and shaping the health care policies of our country. The Directive Principles have placed emphasis on the minutest details of health, nutrition, working conditions and welfare. In addition to the Directive Principles, the Constitution, in 11th and 12th schedules, places an obligation to provide safe drinking water, sanitation and adequate healthcare upon the local bodies.\"\nThe Chief Justice went on to highlight the similarities between those practicing law and medicine.\n\"A good lawyer, like a good doctor, must always work earnestly towards imbibing and accumulating greater knowledge. The possibilities for growth in both fields are seemingly endless. Both medicine and law are the oldest professions in the world. They arise from basic necessities of dignified human existence. People place their faith in lawyers and doctors alike, trusting that they will act in best interests of those who approach them.\"\nNext, he emphasised that the commercialisation of healthcare needs to be checked. \n\"Private hospitals are being opened at an exponential rate. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but there is a glaring need for balance. We are seeing hospitals being run like companies, where profit making is more important than service to society. Due to this, hospitals and doctors alike are desensitized towards the plight of patients. They are just numbers for them. This trend has also spread monopoly and is deepening the inequities in access to health care.\"\nThis meant that the poor reach doctors at a very late stage, he highlighted.\n\"Exorbitant medical fees coupled with excessive barriers has made it almost impossible for the poor to get decent healthcare. It is primarily the cost of healthcare that is forcing people to suppress their healthcare needs and well-being. The heart-breaking fact is that the crucial preventive stage is often lost when people suppress their health needs. They only approach the doctors when it is unmanageable and has crossed a certain threshold.\"\nAttacks on doctors unfortunate\nThe CJI's speech also touched upon the aspect of attacks on doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"During the pandemic I saw various instances where doctors had been threatened, abused, attacked, and shunned. Despite this, they continued working on the front lines. This negative response towards doctors is truly unfortunate. Several false cases are being lodged against upright and hardworking doctors. They need a better, and more secure, working environment. We must foster an environment where more young people want to become doctors to serve Indian society.\" \nCJI Ramana said such developments are leading to a massive brain drain, and to prevent this, doctors must be incentivised to remain in India.\n\"...the government must look out for the welfare of its doctors and improve their working conditions. The government must think of stronger incentives to make doctors accessible to rural population.\""}

{"id": "id_506", "reference_summary": "A criminal conviction cannot stand merely on the basis of apprehensions and sentiments, observed the Jammu and Kashmir High Court recently while acquitting a teacher who had been accused of raping his student. [Mohd Maqbool Ganai V/s Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir]\nJustices Atul Sreedharan and Mohan Lal found that there was no legal evidence to prove that the teacher had committed the alleged rape.\nAmong other factors, the Court found that there was an unexplained delay of 38 days in filing the case and that the medical evidence contradicted the complainant's version of events. \n\"It would be highly dangerous and hazardous to hold the appellant-convict guilty of offences alleged against against him on the basis of weak, shaky and unacceptable evidence,\" the Court concluded.\nBy way of background, a government school teacher was accused by a class 8 student of raping her at his residence after school. She also alleged that the teacher threatened that she would not be allowed to take her exams if she disclosed the incident to anyone else. \nThe alleged incident was said to have taken place in July 2015. However, the complaint was only made 38 days later, in August 2015.\nSuch an unexplained inordinate delay in lodging the complaint led the High Court to doubt the prosecution's case. \n\"If the prosecution fails to explain the delay, there is possibility of embellishments in the prosecution version on account of such delay which would be fatal to the prosecution making the prosecution case highly doubtful and concocted entitling the accused benefit of doubt leading to his acquittal\", reads the judgment,\" the Court said. \nMoreover, the medical exam conducted on the student in August indicated that she had a \"freshly torn hymen\", when could not have taken place 38 days ago, the Court was told. \nAnother inconsistency noticed was in the complainant's testimony itself. While she alleged that the rape took place at 2 PM in the afternoon, she also mentioned that he had lunch with her family and friends on the same day at 2.30 PM. \nThe Court opined that it was highly unlikely that she could have been raped by the accused between these times. \n\"The critical appraisal of the deposition of prosecutrix leads us to the firm conclusion that the story projected by the prosecutrix is far from reality ... it is humanely impossible for one person to be present at two (2) places at the same time,\" the Court said. \nThe Court added that the complainant's version of events cannot be taken as the gospel truth and that without supporting evidence, the teacher's conviction cannot be sustained. \nRelying on the Supreme Court's judgment in Rahul v. State of Delhi, the Court further observed,\n\"No conviction/ punishment can be rendered upon an accused merely on the ground of apprehension and influenced by sentiments. On merits, we find that the prosecution case has been found wanting, as no cogent, conclusive and creditworthy evidence has been led by the prosecution to prove the guilt of appellant/convict.\"\nThe Court, therefore, acquitted the teacher and set aside the trial court judgment which had earlier sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment.\nAdvocates Tahir Ahmad Bhat, Bhat Shafi, Abdul Wakeel Koka appeared on behalf of the teacher. \nDeputy Advocate General Mubeen Wani, along with advocate Ruheela Khan appeared on behalf of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir."}

It is the fundamental duty contemplated under Article 51A of the Constitution. Petitioner’s desire to secure a ‘No Caste, No Religion,’ certificate deserves to be appreciated but the question arises as to whether such certificate can be issued by the Tahsildar in the absence of any power conferred by the Government to issue such nature of Certificate,” the High Court said.\nThe Court recorded the Tamil Nadu government’s submission that the Tehsildar or other revenue authorities do not have any power to issue such certificates to anyone.\nBesides, the Court observed that the Tamil Nadu government through two government orders issued in 1973 and 2000 had already permitted citizens to leave the columns for caste and religion in their school and other educational certificates “blank” if they so wished. \nIssuance of a general direction in the form of a ‘no caste no religion certificate’ could lead to complications in enforcing certain legal rights, the Court said.\n“Issuance of “No Caste No Religion” Certificate would have certain implications. For inheritance/succession personal laws are applied and therefore, a decision by a person and its repercussions are to be looked into. Rule of reservations are availed of by the citizen, therefore, certain decisions, if taken without understanding the repercussions and consequences, would affect the future generations,” the High Court said.\nThe Court accordingly said that the petitioner was at liberty to leave the column provided for caste and religion blank in the school documents and the same cannot be questioned by the authorities. \nHowever, in the absence of any power conferred on a revenue authority to issue such a certificate, the High Court cannot issue a direction, the Court said.\n“In the absence of any power conferred on the Revenue Authority to issue “No Caste No Religion” Certificate, High Court in exercise of powers under Judicial Review under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, cannot issue a direction to issue such certificate, which will open flood gate for other persons to seek such certificate and the authorities will be forced to issue such certificate in the absence of any such powers conferred either under any statute or by the Government,” the High Court said while dismissing the plea.\nAdvocate M Navin Kumar appeared for petitioner H Santosh.\nAdditional Government Pleader Vadivelu Deenadayalan appeared for the respondent State and District authorities."}

As such, there is no rationale behind exclusion of a married daughter from the scheme,\" the Bench observed. \nThe Court thus upheld a single-Judge's judgment that had ruled that Tripura government's exclusion of married daughters from compassionate appointments, was unconstitutional.\n\"A die-in-harness policy inasmuch as it operates as a disqualification in the case of a married woman, as against a married man must be held to be discriminatory and such policy, tested on the touchstone of Articles 14 to 16 of the Constitution, cannot be held to be valid,\" the Division Bench held.\nThe Bench was hearing an appeal by the State against a single-Judge order of the High Court that held a May 2017 notification by the Tripura government as unconstitutional. \nThe text of the the said notification read:\n“Married daughter(s) under any circumstances shall not come under the purview of die-in-harness scheme.”\nThe scheme provides either employment to an eligible dependent family member of a deceased government servant, or financial assistance. \nThe respondents in the present case, four different parties, were denied the former on grounds of being married daughters, who were explicitly excluded from the scheme by the notification.\nThe counsel for the State argued that the scheme does not include a married daughter because under no circumstances can they be treated as a dependent family member of a deceased government employee. The beneficiaries of such schemes are a matter of policy and no aspirant claim a statutory right to the same, it was submitted. \nThe counsel for the petitioners said that complete exclusion of married daughters from the purview of compassionate appointment under the die-in-harness scheme is an impermissible discrimination and violative of Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution.\nThe Bench in the instant case noted how different High Courts have unanimously viewed that complete exclusion of married daughters from the purview of such schemes is \"unreasonable, arbitrary and violative of the equality clauses of the Constitution\", as provided by Articles 14 to 16.\n\"Numerous situations can be contemplated where there may be none other than the married daughter to support the family of the deceased government servant,\" the Court observed. \nThe Court heard the four different appeals together, and rejected the same.\nThe appellant State authorities were directed to consider the applications for compassionate appointment received from the respondents afresh, and dispose of the same on merits within three months. \nGovernment Adovcate D Bhattacharya, Additional Government Adovcate M Debbarma and advocate Soumyadeep Saha appeared for the appellants. \nSenior Advocates P Roy Barman and Somik Deb, and advocates HK Bhowmik, Samarjit Bhattacharjee, K Nath and R Chakraborty appeared for the respondents."}

{"id": "id_536", "reference_summary": "The Rajasthan High Court recently emphasised that the perceptions of societal or public morality cannot stand in the way of protecting couples in live-in relationships, even if one of the partners is married to another.\nWhen the right to life and liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution has been guaranteed in India even to convicted criminals of serious offences, there can be no reason for refusing the same protection to those in “legal/illegal relationships,\" the Court said.\n\"Public morality cannot be allowed to overshadow the constitutional morality, particularly when the legal tenability of the right to protection is paramount\", the judgment stated.\nThe Court noted how the State went above and beyond to protect the terrorist Kasab because India is a country where rule of law is supreme and no liberty can be taken away without due process of law. \n\"Moral policing cannot be allowed to dictate the actions of the state nor can moral policing by the public at large be allowed or forgiven\", the Court observed further.\nIt is well-settled that it is not within the Court's domain to intrude upon an individual's privacy, Justice Dr. Pushpendra Singh Bhati said. \nThe judge further explained that any scrutiny or remark upon the \"so-called morality\" of an individual's relationship or blanket statements of condemnation would simply bolster an intrusion into one's right to choice and condone \"acts of unwarranted moral policing by the society at large.\"\nThe judge went on to highlight that the Court is firmly tied down to the principle of individual autonomy, which cannot be hampered by societal expectations in a vibrant democracy. \nThe State’s respect for the individual, independent choices has to be held high, he said.\n\"This Court fully values the principle that at all junctures constitutional morality has to have an overriding impact upon societal morality. This Court cannot sit back and watch the transgression or dereliction in the sphere of fundamental rights, which are basic human rights,\" the judgement further said. \nThe judge added that if the morality or legality of live-in relations were in dispute before the Court, the answer may have required more deliberation. \nHowever, the question before the Court was confined to whether a live-in couple is entitled to protection under Article 21, it was pointed out. With respect to this issue, the Court said it is clear that there is a Constitutional mandate to give protection.\n\"There arises no question of this right to be waived off even if the person seeking protection is guilty of an immoral, unlawful or illegal act, as per the precedent law cited of the Hon’ble Apex Court. However, in this case, this Court does not wish to delve into the sanctity of relationships,\" the Court said.\nThe judge, ultimately, directed the couple seeking protection to appear before the police authorities who were asked to examine their representation and grant the petitioners adequate security and protection if the same was necessary. \n\"It is sufficiently clear to this Court that the Hon’ble Apex Court’s standpoint is that there exists a duty of the State to protect and safeguard all fundamental rights, unless taken away by due process of law. Even if any illegality or wrongfulness has been committed, the duty to punish vests solely with the State, that too in attune with due process of law. In no circumstance can the State bypass due process, permit or condone any acts of moral policing or mob mentality,\" the Court emphasised. \nThe judge, however, clarified that its order would not affect any criminal and civil proceedings initiated against the petitioners.\nThe question of whether persons in live-in relationships involving partners married to others are entitled to legal protection has been under significant debate in the recent times. \nThe instant Rajasthan High Court order also makes a reference to several of them, including the June 15 Allahabad High Court ruling which concluded that live-in relationship with an already married person is illegal and a May 7 Rajasthan High Court ruling in which the Jaipur Bench observed that a live-in relationship involving married and unmarried persons is impermissible.\nIn diverting from these views, Justice Pushpendra Singh Bhati also relied on several Supreme Court's rulings which dealt with the right to privacy and individual autonomy including Navtej Singh Johar v. Union of India (which decriminalised consensual sexual relations between homosexual persons), Shafin Jahan v. Asokan KM (Hadiya marriage case) and the KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India (wherein right to privacy was declared a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution).\nReferring to these Supreme Court rulings, the Rajasthan High Court has observed:\n\"(The Supreme Court has observed that it is) the duty of the Courts to be guided by constitutional morality by upholding the values enshrined within the constitution and not succumbing to societal morality ... The Apex Court has laid down in no uncertain terms that the emphasis to be given to public morality is minuscule, when they are in conflict with constitutional morality, and that the Courts must uphold constitutional morality and rely on the same rather than obscure notions of societal morality, which have no legal tenability ... In addition to the Courts’ responsibility to uphold the principles of constitutional morality, there exists a parallel duty to not infringe upon the personal relationship between two free- willed adults.\"\nAdvocate Gajendra Panwa appeared for the petitioners.

As the poor people are being forced and not able to avail their fundamental rights, given … it is pertinent to exercise powers under 226 to direct the DoE to ensure people of weaker sections get representation in schools . All the private schools shall ensure that the provisions of the act are given effect in letter and spirit,\" the Court said.\nThe Court was dealing with 39 petitions by students and their parents seeking admission to private schools under the EWS quota. Despite the children possessing confirmed admission letters from the DoE, the schools refused to give them admission.\nCounsel for petitioners claimed that, to add insult to injury, the school gates were literally shut in the faces of the shortlisted students and their parents. \n\"One can just imagine the humiliation faced by the young children and their parents. This Court, as a custodian of the Constitution, cannot remain a mute spectator to the outright bulldozing of human rights by those in the noble service of imparting education, thus bringing bad name and repute to the same,\" the Court remarked.\nThe Court, therefore, issued a slew of directions in the matter:\nAll schools to ensure that provisions of RTE Act are given effect in letter and spirit; \nEWS students shall not be denied admission or treated with conduct unbecoming;\nIn case of erring schools, Department of Education shall issue strong orders and not hesitate in initiating process of de-recognition;\nIn exceptional circumstances, exemption can be granted to a school but the DOE shall ascertain that the reasons are bona fide.\nThe Court also directed that DoE shall ensure that all the students shortlisted and notified to be admitted in a neighborhood school shall be admitted at the earliest within one month or within the period prescribed by the appropriate authority subject to the provisions of the Act.\nThe schools raised a contention regarding frauds being committed by the parents of the students seeking admission, misrepresenting themselves as belonging to weaker section by forging documents and other scrupulous means. \nIn that regard, the Court directed the DoE to carry out necessary screening and seek necessary documents to authenticate the credentials of the child and their parents found fit for admission to respective neighborhood schools under the EWS quota.\nThe Court clarified that mere suspicion or doubt on the credentials of the candidate on the basis of fact-finding exercise carried out by the school, cannot be a ground to deny admission, otherwise it will render a death-knell to the spirit of the RTE Act. \n\"The schools as such, in the matters of admission under the Act/Rules, cannot bestow upon themselves the roles of the complainant, advocate as well as the adjudicator in such cases. Rather, if despite the due process adopted by the DoE for screening, in case the school, after admitting the child, suspects fraud being committed by the ward or their parents, they can seek recourse to legal remedies as available,\" the Court said."}

Therefore, it is a foregone conclusion that disparity and discrimination would be writ large between the two enactments and aspects relating to their implementation. In such a situation, the question of comparing the two legislations, for the purpose of making out a case under Article 14 of the Constitution, would not arise. Such an exercise would be akin to comparing chalk with cheese, i.e., two essentially unequal entities,\" the Court held.\nIn this particular case, the Court noted that purpose of the Highways Act is that the land acquisition processes should not be protracted or ridden by avoidable delays.\n\"No doubt, the scheme of the new LA Act advocates timely measures being adopted in implementation of the acquisition and such general temporal restrictions would benefit the land owners, but the absence of such restrictions in the Highways Act may not be reason enough to invalidate it, as the very premise on which the Highways Acts was enacted by the State of Tamil Nadu was to cut down on time-consuming processes,\" the Court stated.\nThe verdict came on an appeal against a 2019 Madras High Court judgment that had upheld the Act stating that it did not suffer from any inherent arbitrariness. \nHowever, the High Court had said that the Act was effectively void post enactment of the 2013 LA Act. \nDuring the pendency of the appeal, the Tamil Nadu government had passed a Validation Act, which was later approved by the President. This excluded the Highways Act from the ambit of the LA Act 2013. \nThe appellants had based their challenge on the lack of any time limits on in the Highways Act, after which land acquisition would deem to lapse if the land is not used for the purpose it was acquired for.\nThe Court, however, held that any stray cases of delay in acquisition of land under the Highways Act will have to be dealt with on its own merits and cannot be a sufficient ground in itself to invalidate the legislation.\n\"There is no possibility of the State of Tamil Nadu exercising arbitrary discretion in adopting one legislation or the other for the purpose of acquiring lands ...\" the Court stated. \nFurther, the Court noted that Sections 3, 7 and 11 of the Validation Act of 2019 expressly exclude the operation of the new LA Act for the purposes contained in the State Acts which stood revived owing to the assent of the President. \nTherefore, the State of Tamil Nadu would be bound to apply only the Highways Act for acquiring lands for the purposes reserved under the law, the Court held.\nThe appeal was, therefore, dismissed.\nAdvocates Suhrith Parthasarathy and N Subramaniyan appeared for the appellants.\nSenior Advocate and former Attorney General for India KK Venugopal represented the State of Tamil Nadu."}

The petitioner's counsel claimed that he was not provided with a copy of this report.\nThereafter, a second report was issued by the Deputy Commissioner, which also concluded that the RBA certificate was fabricated.\nThe petitioner, thereafter, sought a review of the matter. Consequently, the Divisional Commissioner delegated the task of reviewing the case to a Deputy Commissioner. The Deputy Commissioner concluded that the RBA certificate was valid in his report submitted in July 2018.\nMeanwhile, however, the petitioner was suspended by the High Court's Administrative Committee. Ultimately, in 2021, a Full Court decided to terminate the petitioner's services. This decision was implemented by the government in the same year.\nHe then moved the Court on the judicial side against the decision.\nThe petitioner pointed out that the full court had failed to consider the third report prepared by a Deputy Commissioner in July 2018, which had concluded that the RBA certificate was valid.\nHowever, the division bench noted that the July 2018 report was not prepared by a competent authority.\n\"We are of the opinion that there was no error either in law or on facts of the Full Court relying only upon the reports dated 12.01.2018 and 30.01.2018 as they were the only reports valid in the eyes of law before the Full Court as the report of 07.07.2018 passed in review by the Deputy Commissioner was non-est in the eyes of law, the same being violative of Rule 32 of SRO 126 of 1994,\" the Court held. \nThe Court concluded that the petitioner's entry into service was through fraudulent means.\nConsequently, depriving petitioner of further departmental inquiry did not violate Article 311 of the Constitution (dealing with dismissal, removal or reduction in rank of persons employed in civil capacities under the Union or a State), as also upheld by the Supreme Court, the High Court said.\nThe High Court, therefore, dismissed the petition and upheld the termination of the judicial officer."}

It highlighted that the apology was tendered by Kumre only after his justifications failed.\n\"It is a well-settled principle of law that for being accepted, an apology should be tendered at the initial stage of the contempt proceedings provided that the contemptuous act has not made a scar on the dignity or authority of the Court and has not interfered with the administration of justice,\" it explained.\nKumre was ruled to be guilty of 41 counts of contempt of court as he not only rejected 35 eligible jail inmates' plea for emergency parole during the COVID-19 pandemic but let out six ineligible inmates.\n\"The purpose of releasing a prisoner on parole or furlough is to reform him. When the prisoners are sent from jail to Society, their conduct is watched, and if they give a good account of themselves, the Rules provide that their sentence can be shortened. The purpose is also to give an opportunity to the prisoner to mix up with the members of his family and the Society so that he may feel that he is also a member of the Society,\" the Court observed. \nThe order was passed in a petition by a prisoner, Hanuman Pendam, who claimed that his request for parole during the Covid-19 epidemic was denied by the jail officer because he was 14 days late in returning to the jail when he was previously released on parole.\nThe jail supervisor provided an affidavit in which he stated that 90 other offenders were denied emergency parole because they were not eligible under the regulations. He provided information on six detainees who arrived late after taking leave earlier.\nAmicus Curiae advocate Firdos Mirza pointed out that one prisoner's name was on the list of convicts who were released despite the fact that he had arrived seven days late during one his earlier paroles. Another prisoner overstayed his furlough by seven days but was nonetheless released.\nThe Court ordered the Commissioner of Police and the Additional Chief Secretary (Jail and Prisons) to launch a departmental investigation for contempt after discovering multiple discrepancies in Kumre's affidavit.\nAdvocate Shweta D Wankhede appeared for for the petitioner.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor MK Pathan and advocate SV Sirpurkar appeared for the respondents."}

There cannot be anything more obscene, diabolical and barbaric than this. It is a crime not only against the society, but against the entire humanity. Many of such cases are not brought to the light because of the fact that the social stigma is attached thereto.\"\nIn light of a steep rise in child rape cases according to some surveys, it was incumbent upon courts to provide protection to victims, it added.\n\"According to some surveys, there has been a steep rise in the child rape cases. The children need more care and protection not only by the parents and guardians, but also by the Courts and society at large. The children are natural resource of our country and are also country’s future.\"\nThe appellant moved the High Court challenging judgments passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Palwal in 2012, whereby he was held guilty and awarded the life sentence for rape, murder and other offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nA First Information Report (FIR) was registered after the father of the victim alleged that the appellant kidnapped his minor daughter and fled on his bicycle, as witnessed by the brother of the victim. The child was untraceable until the next morning, when she was found dead in a field.\nThe FIR also stated that after being arrested, the appellant disclosed to the police that he had kept concealed a bag in the corner of the field of maize and parked his bicycle on the Railway Station, Palwal, which was used in the commission of offence.\nCounsel for the appellant had vehemently contended that the entire prosecution case was based on hearsay evidence, and that the witnesses were interested parties.\nCountering this argument, the Court said that that the testimonies of the witnesses (father and brother) could never be rejected on the ground that they were closely related to the victim.\n\"In fact, PW-3 Manish was the most natural witness and the appellant was known to him. Even he was the brother of the victim and his presence near the place of occurrence was natural. Still further, even he was subjected to cross-examination and his testimony was found worthy of placing reliance and was consistent. Still further, no reason for falsely implicating the appellant or any ill-will on the part of the said witnesses has been suggested to both the prosecution witnesses i.e. PW-2 Sunil and PW-3 Manish,\" the order stated.\nThe testimonies of the father and the brother of the victim did not suffer from any infirmity, and the trial court had correctly placed reliance on their testimonies, which were duly corroborated by the other prosecution evidence, the Bench noted.\nIt also rejected the alibi of the appellant, noting that the defence had miserably failed to prove the same.\n\"At this stage, it is observed that taking of a false defence by the appellant would also serve as an additional link in the chain of circumstances, which unerringly established the guilt of the appellant beyond any doubt.\"\nThe appellant was represented by Advocate Rahul Vats, while the prosecution was represented by Advocate Anmol Malik."}
{"id": "id_585", "reference_summary": "Farmers in the country are facing \"all kinds of problems\" but none of the \"systems\" display any sensitivity towards them, the Bombay High Court's Aurangabad Bench lamented refusing to quash criminal proceedings against two persons accused of duping farmers in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.\nA Division Bench comprising Justices TV Nalawade and MG Sewlikar also took exception to the fact that the State did not file appeal against anticipatory bail granted by the Sessions court to the accused. \nIt, therefore, refused to quash proceedings against applicants - MK Khandelwal and his father KD Khandelwal, owners of Khandelwal Transporters - accused of duping farmers by taking their produce for sale and not handing over their share in the sale proceeds to them.\n\"This inability of farmers is used by the traders like applicants and they make money on the agricultural produce which farmers gets after working hard. The suicides of farmers are increasing day by day as farmers are facing all kinds of problems and present problem of cheating is additional circumstance which is compelling the farmers to commit the suicide. Due to all these circumstances, this Court holds that no relief can be granted in favour of applicants,\" the order stated. \nBy way of background, Saniya Kadri who was a broker for agricultural produce was approached by the Khandelwal Transporters to hand over the banana produce collected from farmers to them so that they can find the traders who will give better price to her and she can make more profit. \nAs there was the promise of higher price, Kadri entered into an agreement with the Khandelwal Transporters.\nKadri told the Court that she promised the farmers to give them their share in the sale proceeds within a few days. However, due to non-payment from the transporters, she could not give money to the farmers. \nWhen farmers were pressing hard for their demand, Kadri insisted the transporters to make the payment of the amount but they suggested that she should accept 50 percent of the amount due for satisfaction of entire dues.\nIt was Kadri's submission that at this point, she realised that she was duped and approached the police who then registered FIR for offences punishable under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code.\nKhandelwal Transporters did not admit to the agreement, nor did they admit to the produce being handed over to them. They claimed that they were in the business of transport and were supplying trucks to Kadri who was selling the banana produce to the traders directly.\nThe Court, however, said that from the records submitted before it, there was material to show that offences of misappropriation and cheating against the transporters were made out. \nThey noted that the transporters had, in fact, collected money as sale proceeds from the produce of the farmers but did not pass on the amount to Kadri. \n“The representations were made to give higher price and to make payment immediately and due to that the farmers were attracted and they handed over banana to the informant and informant handed over banana to the applicants. In such cases, inference of conspiracy can also be drawn on the basis of aforesaid circumstances,” the Court observed.\nThe Court, thus, came to the conclusion that Khandelwal transporters made money from the transactions and the farmers ended up being duped. For this reason, the Court refused to quash the case against the Khandelwal transporters.\nEarlier, a co-ordinate Bench of the High Court had refused relief to Kadri who had also drawn the ire of the farmers as she was collecting banana produce from them and was supposed to handover the sale proceeds back to the farmers. An FIR had been registered against Kadri on the basis of the report given by her business partner, Sheikh Mohinoddin. \nA co-ordinate bench of the High Court had refused to quash the FIR against her on the ground that the farmers were the true victims and not Mohinoddin. But Kadri and Khandelwal Transporters were granted protection from arrest by the Sessions Court in the offences registered against them. \nThe High Court expressed its surprise at the fact that this protection was not challenged by the State even though the amount due to the farmers had not been recovered yet.\n“Though some accounts are shown to be seized by the police, that action is not going to help the farmers. This happened only due to relief of anticipatory bail granted in favour of the accused. Thus, the applicants and informant have made money and the farmers are duped. It is surprising that the orders of anticipatory bail made by the Sessions Court were not challenged by the State” the Court said dismissing the applications."}

[M Sivasankar v Union of India & Anr.].\nInterestingly, Justice A Badharudeen who delivered the verdict earlier today, had returned the statements of the witnesses that the Additional Solicitor General of India had submitted as it was in a sealed cover. \n\"The same was returned since `sealed cover production of documents' is not a generally accepted rule,\" the judge explained in the order, seemingly echoing the view taken by the Supreme Court in its recent MediaOne judgment.\nInstead, the judge called for the entire case records from the Special Court and from it, he noted that the prosecution has specific case, prima facie justified by the available records, as to Sivasankar's involvement. \nThe judge also took note of the fact that after Sivasankar was granted bail in the gold smuggling case, he was quickly reinstated to service to a pivotal post in the State of Kerala, ignoring his possible involvement in serious crimes.\n\"..his chance of propensity to tamper with evidence or influencing witnesses, is very much there, since the petitioner is a person having very much influence in the ruling party of Kerala, particularly with the Chief Minister of Kerala. In this matter, the investigation is at the initial stage. Many accused are yet to be arrested including Smt.Swapna Prabha Suresh. Why the prosecution is delaying the arrest of Swapna Prabha Suresh is also a matter of serious concern, though she had an active role in the present crime,\" the order refusing bail stated. \nThe LIFE (Livelihood, Inclusion and Financial Empowerment) Mission is a housing security scheme of the Kerala government which intends to provide houses to all the landless and homeless residents of the State.\nThe case involves one specific project under this scheme which is alleged to have been funded by a foreign entity in violation of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). The issue is also being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\nThe LIFE Mission project ran into trouble in 2020 after Anil Akkara, then MLA for Wadakkanchery in Thrissur district filed a complaint stating that it violated FCRA norms. His specific complaint was against the project in his constituency of Wadakkanchery.\nFor the project, the State government had agreed to allot land to building contractors chosen by the donors. The project at Wadakkanchery was funded by the UAE consulate’s Red Crescent.\nAkkara claimed that the Kerala government obtained funds for Unitac builders (which was chosen as contractor) from Red Crescent, thereby, violating the FCRA.\nThe CBI proceeded to file an FIR pursuant to the complaint, naming Unitac’s Santhosh Eappen, Sane Ventures (another contractor), and “unnamed officials of the LIFE Mission project”.\nThere were charges that the LIFE Mission project was awarded to Eappen and Sane venture at the behest of former UAE Consulate employee and gold smuggling accused Swapna Suresh working with Sivasankar, who was then the principal secretary to the Kerala Chief Minister’s Office.\nSivasankar was arrested on February 14 and has been in custody since then. On March 2, a Special Court for trying offences under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) had dismissed his bail application prompting the present plea before the High Court.\nIn this bail plea, Sivasankar pointed out that the predicate offences, as stated in the arrest order, are an FIR registered by the Vigilance and Anti Corruption Bureau (VACB) under the Prevention of Corruption Act and another FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for offences under the FCRA.\nHe submitted that the ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) says that several persons, among whom are some government officials, received pecuniary advantages and illegal gratification out of the funds received from UAE Red Crescent meant for flood victims in Kerala through the LIFE Mission project.\nThe plea assailed the allegations levelled by the ED on several fronts.\nSivasankar categorically stated that he is a well qualified retired public servant who is completely innocent of all the allegations and that his arrest is nothing but a political stunt.\nThe plea also challenged the approach of the Special Court while dismissing his previous bail plea, especially the fact that it had placed reliance on some documents provided by the ED in sealed covers.\nAppearing for Sivasankar, Senior Advocate Jaideep Gupta argued that the allegations against Sivasankar in the LIFE Mission case arose from the same set of facts involved in the 2020 gold smuggling case in which Swapna Suresh is one of the main accused. \nHe contended that it has been held by the Supreme Court in TT Antony v. State of Kerala that two crimes cannot be registered on same set of facts.\nIt was submitted that the amount of money alleged to have been given as kickbacks to Sivasankar is less than ₹1 crore which allows grant of bail under PMLA.\nGupta also highlighted Sivasankar's medical condition before concluding his arguments.\nAdditional Solicitor General of India, Senior Advocate R Sankaranarayanan, opposed these contentions on behalf of the Central agency.\nHe said that the facts leading to the registration of the two cases are different. He also alleged that the High Court had previously granted bail to Sivasankar in the gold smuggling case on medical grounds but that he had subsequently declined medical procedures and returned to work a few weeks after he was released."}

Spending for unnecessary things [in] crores - crores! Education is your fundamental duty! ... Sir, the children’s plight … education ... we will not tolerate these things… Is this not a shame on the State government? ... This is unfortunate”, he said during the course of the hearing.\nThe Court also expressed anguish over the apparent step-motherly treatment meted out to government school students, when compared to students who can afford to go to private schools.\n“If the people sitting on the chairs, if they don’t have humanity, this is all a problem. They should have humanity. Their children never go to government schools … We will not tolerate this type of stepmother attitude to the children,” Justice Veerappa remarked.\nThe Court further took critical note that a government order passed in June 2021 only provided for giving one set of uniforms to government school students.\nAn affidavit filed by a State authority disclosed that money had been transferred for the purchase of uniforms, socks, and shoes to the school headmasters concerned. The Court recorded the same in its order, but raised concern that this would not ensure that such funds actually reached the beneficiaries, i.e. the students. \nDuring the hearing, the bench queried if any authority has been designated to monitor the matter. In its order, the Court ultimately opined that there is no clarity in the said affidavit on whether the State has strictly complied with the High Court’s earlier directions.\n“God only knows whether it really reached the beneficiaries, the students and fulfilled the objects of the provisions of the RTE Act,” the Court commented.\nThe bench went on to emphasise that it is high time that the State open its eyes and implement its fundamental duty to provide school uniforms to government school students aged between 6 to 14 years. This duty has been laid down in Section 3 of the RTE Act and Articles 21A and 45 of the Constitution of India (dealing with free and compulsory education for children between the ages of 6-14 years), the Court noted.\nThe Court further recorded that the State counsel had sought some more time to file a detailed affidavit indicating the implementation of the Court’s orders in its true spirit. The request was acceded to and the matter adjourned, but not before the Court warned that it would impose costs if the State’s apparent lapses were to continue.\n“… further time is given to State, failing which the officer concerned shall be present before this court to pay the charge,” the Court cautioned.\nThe case concerns the implementation of a 2019 order passed by a Chief Justice-led bench of the High Court, wherein two months was given to the State to provide two sets of uniforms to students pursuing elementary education in government schools. \nThe order was passed in a public interest litigation (PIL) petition moved by a class III government school student, through his father. [Master Manjnath v. Union of India and ors]\nThe Court, in that case, had concluded that the duty to provide uniforms is inherent under Section 3 of the RTE Act, and also noted that Rule 5 of the State’s Rules also acknowledged this duty. \nNotably, the Court had also observed that it is not sufficient to simply provide one set of uniform to the students as the State cannot expect children to wear one set of uniform throughout the week.\n“Apart from being arbitrary and irrational, it will be totally unhygienic. Moreover, due to the failure of the State to provide the second set of uniform, the parents or students may be forced to pay for the second uniform. This will be in violation of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21-A of the Constitution of India and also in violation of sub-section (2) of Section 3 of the RTE Act as well as Rule 5 of the State Rules. There is enough indication in Rule 5 of the State Rules about the entitlement of students to more than one set of uniforms and not merely to one set of uniform,” the Court had observed."}

It came on record that though he hadn’t signed the certificate till date, the children had been admitted to the new school.

On the one hand, an insouciant litigant can mischievously stall the pending trial court proceedings by simply filing a frivolous petition and on the other hand it tantamount to a direct onslaught upon the fundamental rights of the litigants attempting to seek speedy and effective justice, by unnecessarily over burdening the dockets and directly impinging upon the precious judicial time of the Appellate Court.”\nUnless the courts start imposing appropriate costs, the menace of such litigation would continue to mar the entire system, the Court further opined. The present appeal was stated to be not only frivolous but also an “insidious effort” to delay the trial court proceedings.\nThe order, therefore, held, “I deem it appropriate that the instant appeal not only deserves to be dismissed but the appellant also deserves to be saddled with the cost of ₹30,000 for his mischievous approach.

This would enable the party concerned to safeguard the evidence till the show-cause notice is taken up for adjudication.\nIf the notices are kept in call book, the parties gets an opportunity to point out to the revenue that the reasons for keeping it in call book are not correct and that the notices should be adjudicated promptly.\n“The law laid down by the Division Bench of this Court in the case of Parle International Limited (supra), applies to the facts of this case.

It was found that the cumulative effect of these factors led her to commit suicide.\n“No Indian lady is ready to share her husband at any cost. They are literally possessive about their husband. It would be biggest jolt for any married woman that her husband is being shared by some other lady or he is going to marry some other lady,” he observed.\nFurther, the Court noted that in such an awkward situation, it would be impossible to expect any sanity from the wife.\nThe husband and his relatives had filed a revision application before the High Court after a trial court rejected their discharge application. They were accused of cruelty, abetment of suicide, theft, voluntarily causing hurt, bigamy, insult and criminal intimidation.\nA First Information Report (FIR) was lodged after the deceased filed a complaint with vivid details of the atrocities allegedly committed on the part of her husband and his family members.\nShe stated that they got married in 2010 and had a baby boy, who was two years old. This was the husband’s second marriage, without divorcing his first wife, and now, he was going to marry a third time.\nThe revisionists highlighted various loopholes in the investigation, time taken to register the FIR, the post-mortem report and other documents as grounds for their plea.\nHowever, the Court said that it would not be proper to comment on these alleged inconsistencies, as it was not supposed to hold a mini trial at the stage of deciding a discharge application. In fact, the Court said that it only needed to be satisfied that the accusations were not frivolous and that there was some material for proceeding further with the case.\n“It would be hazardous to act on the discrepancies unless they are so fatal and glaring as to affect the credibility of the prosecution case without affording reasonable opportunity to the prosecution to substantiate the allegations,” it was recorded.\nJustice Chaturvedi also said that the FIR would be considered as the informant’s dying declaration that she authored herself, a day before she committed suicide.\n“...soon after coming to know that her husband got married in clandestine way with some other lady, by itself is more than sufficient reason to commit suicide. Sushil Kumar, the husband seems to be the main culprit at least to be tried for the offence under section 306 IPC.”\nFinding no reason to interfere with the trial court order, the Court dismissed the discharge plea filed by the husband and his relatives.

Therefore, having acquired the status of Coparcener, the respondent No.1 [Sujata Sharma] should be entitled to acquire the status of Karta,” it added.\nLooking into Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, the Court said the provision clearly states that that “a daughter of a coparcener shall by birth become a coparcener in her own right in the same manner as a son and any reference to a Hindu Mitakshara Coparcener shall be deemed to include a reference to a daughter of a coparcener.”\nIn this backdrop, the Court said though the reference in the Preamble of the Act may be to inheritance, the conferring of “same” rights would include all other rights including the right to be a Karta.\nThe Court rejected the argument that the husband of a female Karta would have an indirect control over the activities of the HUF of her father’s family. It called it a parochial mindset.\n“Ergo, a woman who has absolute ownership in a property cannot be denied a right to manage it on the warped reasoning that she may get influenced by her in-laws. Thus, societal apprehension and reluctance can never truncate legislative enactments to do away with patriarchal discrimination,” the bench said.\nThus, the Court declared Sujata Sharma as the Karta for the purposes of representing the HUF of DR Gupta & Sons before the Competent Authority. It thus dismissed the appeal. \nAdvocates Aslam Ahmed, Charu Shriyam Singh and Abhishek Dwivedi represented the appellant.\nAdvocate Aakanksha Kaul was Amicus Curiae in the case and appeared with Advocates Manek Singh, Aman Sahani and Harsh Ojha.\nAdvocate Mala Goel represented the main defendant. \nAdvocates Anita Trehan, Dr. Sarita Dhuper, Kajal Chandra, Prerna Chopra, Divye Puri Sakshi Anand, Brajesh Kr.

Showing undue leniency to the accused in such a case will undermine public confidence in the efficacy of our legal system,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also clarified that nine of these convicts will have to undergo at least 20 years of imprisonment before they can even apply for a remission (early release) of their sentence.\nThe nine convicts sentenced on these terms are Anoop, Manoj Kumar, NK Sunil Kumar (Kodi Suni), Rajesh Thundikkandi, KK Muhammed Shafi, Sijith S, K Shinoj, KC Ramachandran, and Manojan (A1-A8 and A11).\nFor two other convicts, namely K Krishnan and Geothy/ Jyothi Babu (A10 and A12), the Court upheld the life sentence, but without a rider that they must complete 20 years in prison before they can apply for remission. \n\"As regards A10 and A12, we find that although the gravity of the offence proved against them warrants a treatment similar to the others, A10 is now 76 yrs old, frail and weak with many medical issues and A12 is 62 and is undergoing medical treatment for multiple ailments. We therefore sentence then to undergo imprisonment for life without curtailing their right to remission,\" the Court said. \nThe life sentence earlier imposed on another convict, PV Rafeek (A18) by the trial court was also upheld. \nNotably, the Court also opined that the fine amount imposed for the crime by the trial court was insufficient, and therefore, enhanced the same with respect to all convicts, except one (A18). Of the fine amounts imposed, the Court also ordered that a part of it should be paid to the family of Chandrasekharan.\n\"We are of the view that a sum of ₹7.5 lakhs to the wife and ₹5 lakhs to the son of the deceased would be reasonable and adequate,\" the Court ordered. \nA division bench of Justices AK Jayasaniaran Nambiar and Kauser Edappagath pronounced the sentencing order this afternoon.\nThe Court was dealing with appeals filed against the trial court judgment in the TP Chandrasekharan murder case.\nChandrasekharan, a former member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] who founded the Revolutionary Marxist Party (RMP), a breakaway of CPI(M) was murdered in 2012 near Onchiyam in Kozhikode district.\nThe prosecution’s case was that the assailants were hired by certain CPI(M) functionaries to eliminate Chandrasekharan who posed a challenge to the party's influence in the area.\nA trial court convicted twelve of the 36 persons accused on May 4, 2012, among whom 11 were sentenced to life imprisonment.\nThe verdict was challenged by the convicts. Appeals were also filed by the Kerala government and KK Rema, the wife of the slain RMP leader, who sought the enhancement of sentence and challenged the trial court's decision to acquit the remaining accused. \nOn February 19, the High Court had upheld the trial court's conviction and also additionally convicted two more persons (local committee members K Krishnan and Jyothi Babu) who had been acquitted by the trial court, bringing the total number of convicts to twelve. \nOne of the persons convicted by the trial court (A13) passed away during the pendency of the appeal before the High Court. \nWhile hearing the convicts on the question of their sentence today, the bench had commented on the impact of political murders in the State.\n\"Political murders are the bane of our State. We cannot afford to take these lightly. It has become the bane of our existence.. The brutality of the murder, the henious manner in which it was committed, the fact that it was an attack on democracy itself, the fact that it was done by several people against one helpless man, the fact that the victim was a public person...It is about time we took a serious view with regard to political murders. It is the bane of our existence,\" the bench observed orally.\nThe bench also noted that the jail reports on the convicts and their conduct while on parole did not suggest any probability or possibility of reform.\n\"These gentlemen don't want to reform. We will give them the benefit of doubt but the only basis we have to assume that they may reform is the fact that all of them have families, and children. These are people who committed crimes when they were out on parole\", the bench remarked orally.\nMost of the convicts had requested for leniency on grounds of medical issues and being sole breadwinners in their respective families. Some convicts also claimed that they had been beaten up in police custody leading to spinal injuries. \nSpecial Public Prosecutor Kumarankutty countered that not all murder cases are the same and that the nature of this one calls for the perpetrators to be punished with the highest sentence possible. It was argued that no other mode of punishment, except the death penalty would satisfy the conscience of justice. \nSenior Advocate B Raman Pillai, appearing for some of the convicts, argued that the prosecutor's arguments were more in the nature of a political speech. \nTo Pillai's submission that this is not the first political murder in the State, Justice Nambiar had replied, \"It is not the first, but it should certainly be the last. It is the bane of our existence.\"\nThe Court ultimately decided to hold off on imposing the death penalty, but upheld the imposition of a life sentence on all the convicts. \n\"A crime like this has to be considered a crime against society at large. While the crimes of the convicts before us are abhorrent, they cannot be considered to be rarest of the rare,\" the Court reasoned today."}

Hence, Navlakha is entitled to default bail, it was argued.\nSibal had told the Court that the period for which Navlakha was confined to his house under house arrest should be calculated as part of judicial custody and should be taken into account while deciding the custody period. \nSibal stated that any order confining a person to custody by order of the court was deemed to be judicial custody. \nHe concluded his submissions by remarking that “arrest is a matter of law, custody is a matter of fact.\"\nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the NIA, opposed the application, contending that the special court had rightfully held that Navlakha's house arrest did not constitute detention. He added that during such house arrest, Navlakha was not accessible for interrogation as is the case with regular custody.\nRaju referred to the Delhi High Court order quashing Navlakha's arrest to point out that after such quashing, Navalakha had gone ahead and filed an anticipatory bail application which shows that the house arrest was not custody as per Section 167(2), CrPC.\n“He was neither in custody nor out on bail, he was a free man,” Raju argued.\nThe question before the Court was whether the time period of Navlakha's house arrest is to be included in the period of custody, in which case he would qualify for default bail under Section 167(2), CrPC."}

The respondent was also one of the bidders for plot area 27,887.50 sq. meters. The offer of the respondent was ₹725 per sq. meter, which being the highest bid, was finally accepted.\nThe appellants informed the respondents that it has been decided to lease out the plot area of 27887.50 sq. meters in his favour for a consideration of ₹2.06 crore and directed the respondent to deposit a sum of ₹1,91 crore upto the period of October 31, 1999 in addition to the earnest money. \nAs per the stipulation, the construction work was to be completed within the period of two years and on failure to deposit the instalments, the security amount would be forfeited.\nThe respondent deposited the above-stated sum from September 1997 to the last instalment on August 25, 2005. Notably, despite the respondent failed to deposit the instalments in terms of conditions of the bid document by October 31, 1999 and the final amount was deposited on August 25, 2005. But no action was taken by the appellants either for cancellation of the bid or for forfeiture of the amount deposited by the respondent. The lease deed was executed by the respondent without any demur.\nAfter a period of three and half years, the respondent moved the High Court seeking a mandamus against appellants to execute the lease deed for the remaining area of 9625.50 sq. meters in addition to the lease earlier executed in favor of the respondent. The High Court allowed the said prayer.\nAggrieved, the appellants preferred the present appeal before the apex court.\nBefore the top court, the appellants argued lease deed was duly executed between the parties without demur and with the consent of the parties, as they were signatories to the lease deed for 18262.89 sq. meters which was executed on March 29, 2006.\nIt was further emphasised that the auction proceedings which were initiated at the first instance on March 13, 1997, finally culminated in the execution of the lease deed and thereby, the transaction attained finality. \nTherefore, it was stated that there was no reason for the respondent to move the High Court and try to reopen the transaction which was finally concluded, that too after three years.\nIt was further argued that there was no justification available to invoke the jurisdiction under Article 226 with a direction to execute the lease deed for the remaining area of land i.e. 9625.50 sq. meters without any consideration and that amounted to amendment to the lease deed which was not permissible in law.\nOpposing the plea, the respondent submitted that once the tender was floated by the appellants for 27887.50 sq. meters and the bid of the respondent was the highest and accepted by the appellants and the last instalment of August 25, 2005 was accepted, there was no justification available with the appellants to segregate and sever the land which was put to auction into two parcels.\nIt was argued that keeping away the remainder of the land has compelled the respondent to move the High Court under Article 226.\nAt the outset, the top court expressed strong displeasure on the undue indulgence shown by the appellants by allowing the respondent to deposit the installment eight years after the due date, and not forfeiting the claim on default.\n\"We have our strong reservations and such exercise of power by the Authority, in our view, is a clear abuse of discretion which is not only violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, but also smacks of an undue favour which is always to be avoided and whenever there is such a business/commercial transaction, it is always to be examined on the commercial principles where equity has no role to play,\" the Court said.\nWith regard to the interference by the High Court, the top court made it clear that when the parties have already executed the lease deed, as on March 29, 2006, it was not open for the High Court to alter or amend the same under Article 226.\n\"The fact is that the parties sitting across the table, got the lease deed executed for 18262.89 sq. meters without demur on 29th March, 2006 and the transaction stood concluded after execution of the lease deed, which was initiated pursuant to a tender floated by the appellant on 13th March, 1997 and since the lease deed was to be compulsorily registered under Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908, it was nowhere open to be altered or amended even by the High Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution,\" the Court observed while setting aside the order of the High Court.\nHowever, considering the pendency of the instant case and the escalation in the value of the property in question, the Court asked the appellant to consider making available one opportunity to the respondent for the remainder of the area on priority basis on the prevalent circle rate notified by the government."}

The petitioners sought setting up COVID care facilities in the University Campus, a COVID response team etc.\nThe Court noted that there are 12,000 – 15,000 people residing in the campus, including students, staff members, faculty and their families but without any Covid care facility at all.\nThe campus medical centre, the Court said, is a small area with 1 Chief Medical Officer, 2 Medical officers and 2 staff nurses – some of whom are also not currently available. \n\"Thus, in case there is a sudden surge, the residents in the campus may face difficulties and there is a need to take further steps apart from what has already been taken by the Covid Task Force and the Covid Response Team,\" the Court opined. \nThe Court directed setting up a Covid Care Centre after the premises for the same is identified by the COVID Task Force in consultation with the SDM concerned. \nIf any paramedic/nursing staff are required, the SDM concerned and JNU Task Force shall arrive at a consensus on how the same is to be arranged, the Court added as it suggested that doctors on campus also could be empanelled for volunteering, if required. \n\"It is expected that the students and the faculty association, as also the administration of JNU, would work together for the betterment of the residents and students of the JNU campus and shall not take any adversarial measures against each other,\" the Court clarified. \nDuring the course of the hearing, the Registrar of JNU informed the Court that a COVID Task Force of nine members had already been set up and since April 18, several patients who required hospitalisation were rendered assistance. \nIt was added that there about 100 volunteers are in place attending to telephone calls and emails from asymptomatic/symptomatic patients 24x7, along with the COVID Task Force. \nSeveral letters had also been addressed to Delhi Government, Central government and NGOS, the Art of Living and Khalsa Aid, for tying up with JNU for providing COVID relief, it was said. \nFurther, in the tests held at four testing camps, 385 persons were found to be positive with COVID-19, including students, staff members, faculty and the family members.

For a young boy of 20 years of age suffering of any kind of disability due to no fault of his cannot be justified or trivialized,” Justice Singh has said.\nThe Court was dealing with a petition filed by one Tarun Preet Singh seeking compensation of ₹1 crore from the government. The petition had been pending since 1998.\nThe Court was told that Singh was meeting two of his friends -- Jagjit Singh and Pradeep Goyal – in Connaught Place when a ten-member team of Delhi Police’s crime branch opened fire at their blue sedan in March 1997. \nPolice had said that the target of the operation was gangster Mohammed Yasneen, who was also expected to be travelling in the same coloured car. \nJagjit and Pradeep died after being taken to hospital, Tarun Preet survived. His counsel told the Court that though he was discharged by the hospital in April 1997, he is living with shrapnel in his body till today and has disability in his right hand.\nWhile Jagjit and Pradeep’s families were granted a compensation of ₹15 lakh each in the year 2011, Tarun Preet received an ad-hoc compensation of ₹1 lakh in 1999.\nJustice Singh noted that the petitioner still has shrapnel in his body, which by itself is traumatizing because side effects of the same may be unknown and the compensation awarded should, therefore, take care of not merely his present condition but any future complications that may arise.\n“He has two children for whom he needs to cater in terms of education and marriage. The fact that other two friends passed away but the Petitioner was merely injured cannot result in different standards being applied, inasmuch as even in the case of Petitioner, who is alive, he has lost the prime of his life. He is working in a cloth shop, has two children and a family to take care of. The time that has gone by also cannot be compensated for him,” the Court said. \nThe single-judge opined that when an injury has been caused due to government machinery and that too, where police officials are convicted of criminal offences, then the same needs to be considered at higher standard as compared to those of ordinary cases of negligence and inaction.\nTherefore, the Court was of the opinion that compensation should have been paid to the petitioner in 1997 itself.\n“Accordingly, keeping in mind inflation rates, a sum of ₹15 lakh is awarded as compensation, which shall be paid along with simple interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of incident till the date of payment.”\nThus, an amount of around ₹45 lakh would have to be given to the petitioner. \nThe Court has also said that a sum of ₹2 lakh shall be paid to Singh as litigation costs and ₹1 lakh shall be adjusted if it has already been paid in terms of the order of 1999.\nThe amount has to be paid within eight weeks, failing which an interest of 7.5% per annum will accrue on the total amount.\nAdvocates Sachin Jain and Isha Aggarwal appeared for the petitioner.

He informed the Commission that despite booking the hotel four months in advance and paying the full amount, MakeMyTrip failed to secure reservation leaving him stranded and incurring additional expenses.\nHe further stated that he had received the refund for the booking amount, but was not compensated for the exorbitant fees he paid for making alternative arrangements. \nOn that account, he sought a direction to MakeMyTrip to bear the additional expenses he incurred towards booking another hotel.

Accordingly, MakeMyTrip sought dismissal of the complaint with costs.\nThe commission found the platform's argument of acting as a facilitator insufficient \nThe Court emphasised that consumers place their trust on such platforms when travelling. \n\"It is not accepted that the contention taken by OP about liability for the deficiency of service is unfair. Since, the complainant has trusted the OP app and booked the hotel believing OP is rendering good services to customers.

Considering the grounds assigned, we are not inclined to grants reliefs in interim applications,\" the Court ruled.\nIn his plea filed through Rashmikant & Partners, Malik assailed the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR), his arrest and his remand, terming them illegal. He stated that such illegal acts rendered his continued detention illegal and without jurisdiction, entitling him to a writ of habeas corpus and immediate release.\nHe also sought setting aside of the order of the special PMLA judge dated February 23 by which he was remanded to ED custody for 8 days.\nED opposed the plea with a preliminary reply, claiming that Malik sought to combine multiple causes of action in his plea, which was not maintainable. The agency sought dismissal of the writ petition on the ground that filing of the same was a dilatory tactic to derail an ongoing investigation.\nDuring the hearing which went on for 3 days, arguments were made by Senior Advocate Amit Desai on behalf of Malik. ED was represented by the Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh.\nDesai made the following submissions: \nThat Malik had been implicated though there was no predicate offence;\nThat the case against Malik was based on statements by persons (belonging to the underworld or connected to people from the underworld) who are not credible;\nThat the transactions for which Malik has been implicated are from 1999, 2003 and 2005, at a time when there was no Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA);\nQuestioned how Malik could have been arrested for an offence under Section 3 of PMLA when the alleged predicate offences were committed prior to 2005 and amendments to Section 3 were introduced only in 2013;\nReiterated that Malik was arrested for a 22-year-old transaction after applying PMLA retrospectively;\nThat personal liberty of a man should not be taken away in the circumstances of the present case;\n\"Habeas corpus is the 'brahmastra' of the judiciary, the most powerful weapon to uphold someone's liberty\" he remarked in conclusion.\nThe ASG, meanwhile, opposed the plea with the following submissions, apart from assailing its maintainability:\nThat habeas corpus will lie only if the remand order is mechanical or absolutely illegal. In the present case, the order was passed after careful consideration of all submissions and material on record before the special PMLA judge;\nThat offences under Sections 3 and 4 of PMLA were separate offences which were independent of the offences mentioned in the schedule of PMLA;\nThat even if the Court concluded that the “predicate offence” which has led to the money laundering is quashed, the offence of money laundering will independently survive;\nThat money laundering is an independent offence, to which the rigors of Section 45 of PMLA apply;\nThe release sought by Malik was essentially in the nature of bail and hence the twin conditions under Section 45 (II) under PMLA would apply;\nIn view of this, the Court has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the offence or is not likely to commit any offence while on bail;\nThat ECIR is a private document for the internal record of ED and cannot be quashed;\nRelying on the original arrest memo which showed that Section 19 of PMLA was complied with, it was submitted that Malik's arrest was legal.\nAfter hearing the arguments at length, the Bench reserved the verdict on March 11 which was pronounced today. \nED had arrested Malik on allegations that he had allegedly purchased property from underworld don Dawood Ibrahim for an amount of ₹20 lakh (through a company controlled by him - Solidus Investments Pvt.

State of Tamil Nadu and Ors. in which it was held that rummy is primarily a game of skill. \nMoreover, the top court had held that competitions where success depended on substantial degree of skill would not amount to gambling and for that reason could not be prohibited under State gambling and gaming legislations. \nThe petitioners, therefore, contended that any profit derived by the petitioners from offering a game of skill such as online rummy played with stakes, is a 'business' that stands protected under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India.\nIt was also contended that the power under Section 14A of the Kerala Gaming Act,1960 is limited to specifying what is a game of sufficient skill to warrant the exemption from gambling regulations.\nAs it is a settled position that rummy is a game of skill for the purpose of State gambling and gaming regulations, the notification banning online rummy is ultra vires Article 246 of the Constitution, the plea said. \nThe Court found merit in the arguments of the petitioners and issued the order declaring the notification issued by the government as unenforceable. \nThe petitioners were represented by advocates Santhosh Mathew, Thomas P Kuruvilla, P Prijith and Martin Jose. \nThe Madras High Court had also recently struck down an amendment to the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, 1930 imposing a ban on online gaming, including online rummy and online poker with stakes.\nThe Bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy concluded that by imposing a wide ranging complete ban, least intrusive test was violated and the ban had, thereby, fallen foul of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India (right to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business)."}

{"id": "id_794", "reference_summary": "A live-in relationship between two adults who are married may be socially unacceptable but it is not a offence, the Delhi High Court recently held [S Rajadurai v State (NCT) of Delhi & Anr].\nIn a judgment delivered on September 13, Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma said that moral wrongdoing from the societal perspective and legal criminal wrongdoings are two separate issues, and though some in society may heavily be critical of a live-in relationship between two married individuals, many others may not.\n\"Live-in relationship between two consenting married adults, who are married to different partners, has not been made criminal or legislated against. While concluding that legal enforcement of morals has not been legislated against, and cannot be a subject matter of any legal morality preached through a judgment (sic),\" the Court said.\nHence, though judges might have their own views regarding such relationships, they cannot attach criminality to such acts based on their perceived notions of morality, the Court emphasised.\n“It would be a dangerous proposition to attach criminality to acts that have not been legislated against on the basis of perceived morality. Judges, as individuals, may have different notions of morality, which cannot be imposed on any party,” the single-judge stated. \nPertinently, the Court ruled that when a woman is not legally eligible to marry someone due to her existing marriage to another person, she cannot allege rape by claiming that she was induced into a sexual relationship under the false pretext of marriage.\n\"The protection and remedies available under Section 376 of the IPC cannot be extended to a victim who was not legally entitled to marry the person with whom she was in sexual relationship with. A case can be made out under Section 376 of IPC, if the victim can prove that she was induced into a sexual relationship under false pretext of marriage by the other party being legally eligible to enter into a marriage with such person,\" the Court underscored.\nIt opined that individual adults are free to make decisions even though such decisions might not align with societal norms or expectations. However, in such cases, they have to remain ready to face potential consequences of such relationships, the Court said.\nIt made these observations while dealing with a plea filed by a man seeking the quashing of a first information report (FIR) registered against him for the offence of rape on allegations by a woman that he established sexual relations with her on the false pretext of marriage.\nThey were stated to be a live-in relationship and both were married.\nIn his plea as well as written submission seeking the quashing of the FIR, the petitioner used derogatory language against the woman.\nJustice Sharma said that such submission falls short of the decency expected in legal pleadings.\n“Therefore, this Court is of the opinion that although the immorality of the act on the part of the female partner was argued at length before this Court, the same standard applies to the male partner, and no distinction should be made based on gender, as doing so would perpetuate misogynistic thinking,” the judgment said.\nDealing with the issue of both the parties being married to other people and yet indulging in a live-in relationship, the Court said that an act may be socially unacceptable but it is not a crime.\n“Courts of law cannot serve as legal moralists preaching morality. They must critically examine the criminal aspects derived from the facts of each case,” Justice Sharma observed.\nThe Court was of the view that women can make choices as equals and that these choices must be respected, irrespective of the age-old notion of women carrying the burden of morality on their shoulders.\nOn the man's plea to quash the FIR, the Court held that when a woman was not legally eligible to marry someone else due to her existing marriage to another partner, she could not claim that she was induced into a sexual relationship under the pretext of marriage.\nIn the present case, it was evident that the petitioner-man could not have entered into a legal marriage with the complainant and there was no valid basis for the complainant to entertain the notion of a promise of a marriage from him, since she (by virtue of her existing marriage) was ineligible to marry.\nTherefore, the Court allowed the man's plea and quashed the FIR.\nAdvocate S Selvakumari appeared for the petitioner, S Rajadurai.\nAdditional Standing Counsel Rupali Bandhopadhya represented the State.\nAdvocates Varun Kumar, MD Jangra and Shitanshu appeared for the complainant woman."}
{"id": "id_805", "reference_summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently held that the rigors of Section 33(5) of the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) which bars repeated examination of a child survivor gets diluted such survivor turns 18 [Mahammad Ali Akbar vs State of Karnataka].\nAs a result, such a survivor can be called to court for further examination Single-judge Justice M Nagaprasanna held. \nOnce the child attains majority, there isn't any bar to call her to testify before the court repeatedly, the Court underlined.\n\"Once the victim crosses 18 years of age, the rigor of Section 33(5) of the Act gets diluted, as it is the child-victim who shall not be called for cross-examination or re-examination repeatedly. On the child attaining 18 years of age, the rigor under Section 33(5) of the Act gets diluted and sequentially, will not become a bar for seeking further cross-examination of the victim under Section 311 of the CrPC,\" the judge held.\nIn the instant case, the judge noted that when the first information report (FIR) was lodged, the girl was 15 year old and now she has turned 18 years.\n\"A reading of Section 33(5) of the Act would clearly indicate the intention behind such enactment that in genuine cases the child-victim is not harassed. That would not mean that the accused can be deprived of his right to cross-examination in a trial, particularly, where offence punishable is beyond ten years. The mandatory nature to recall the witness for cross-examination, if the evidence appears to be essential, is always necessary for a just decision in a case, save in cases where repeated applications under Section 311 of the CrPC are filed on frivolous reasons,\" the Court said in its order passed on June 6.\nThe bench further clarified that since there is a presumption against the accused in a POCSO case under Section 29 of the Act, it becomes all the more important for the accused to adduce evidence against such presumption.\nThe bench was seized of a plea challenging orders of a special POCSO court that dismissed the appellant's plea seeking recall of the victim in the case so that he could further cross-examine her. The special court had relied upon section 33(5) of the POCSO law while dismissing the plea. \nHowever, Justice Nagaprasanna noted the submission of the appellant that the survivor's father in his testimony before the court had stated that appellant was a relative and never subjected his daughter to any sexual act and that they both loved each other.\n\"The petitioner, who is now facing trial for offences punishable under the POCSO Act, if convicted, would end up with conviction of more than 10 years. In such a case, the accused should be given an opportunity to defend himself, except in cases where an application is filed by adopting dilatory tactics. The reason rendered in the application filed is clear that it is filed only after the admission of the victim's father that there was no sexual act committed by him. Therefore, the order rejecting the application despite the soul and spirit of Section 311 Cr.P.C is thus rendered unsustainable,\" the judge said.\nHence, recalling the survivor to testify would be imperative to see that the trial does not result in miscarriage of justice in any manner, the Court ruled.\nAdvocate Syed Muzakkir Ahmed appeared for the accused while the State was represented by Government Pleader K P Yashodha."}
{"id": "id_807", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the Constitutional validity of Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) [Vijay Madanlal Choudhary v Union of India].\nThe judgment was pronounced by a bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar on a batch of 241 petitions challenging the validity of the law.\nThe Court upheld the validity of Sections 3 (definition of money laundering), 5 (attachment of property), 8(4) [taking possession of attached property), 17 (search and seizure), 18 (search of persons), 19 (powers of arrest), 24 (reverse burden of proof), 44 (offences triable by special court), 45 (offences being cognizable and non-bailable and twin conditions for grant of bail by court) and 50 (statements made to ED officials).\nThe Court also held that the supply of Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) under PMLA proceedings is not mandatory since ECIR is an internal document and cannot be equated to a First Information Report (FIR). \n\"ECIR cannot be equated with FIR and ECIR is an internal document of ED. Supply of ECIR to accused is not mandatory and only disclosure of reasons during arrest is enough. Even the ED manual is not to be published since it is an internal document,\" the Court held. \nThe Court also rejected the argument about proportionality of punishment under PMLA act with respect to scheduled offences as wholly \"unfounded\". \nHowever, the Court held that question of enactment of amendments in 2019 to PMLA Act as money bill has to be decided by a larger bench of seven judges before whom the same question is already pending. \nOn Section 3 (money laundering definition)\nSection 3 has wider reach and it deals with direct and indirect proceeds of crime. Explanation to Section 3 is clarificatory in nature. \n\"We are clearly of the view that the expression “and” occurring in Section 3 has to be construed as “or”, to give full play to the said provision so as to include “every” process or activity indulged into by anyone,\" the Court stated.\nThus, projecting a property as untainted property would constitute money laundering on its own being an independent process or activity.\n\"The interpretation suggested by the petitioners that only upon projecting or claiming the property in question as untainted property that the offence of Section 3 would be complete, stands rejected,\" the Court thus said.\nThis would mean that mere concealment or possession or acquisition or use of proceeds of crime will amount to money laundering. \nThe explanation inserted to Section 3 by way of amendment on 2019 does not expand its purport but was only clarificatory, the court held.\n“Being a clarificatory amendment, it would make no difference even if its introduced by way of the finance act or otherwise,” the Court added.\nOn predicate offence\nThe Court made it clear that the offence under Section 3 is dependent on illegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. It is concerning the process or activity connected with such property which constituted the offence of money laundering.\nThe authorities under the 2002 cannot prosecute any person on notional basis or on the assumption that a scheduled offence is committed unless it is so registered with the jurisdictional police and/ or is pending inquiry trial before a competent forum, the Court held.\nPertinently, acquittal or discharge in predicate offence or quashing of such offence will lead to offence of money laundering also falling. \n“If a person is finally discharged and acquitted of the scheduled offence or criminal case against him is quashed by a court of competent jurisdiction, there can be no offence of money laundering against him or anyone claiming such property being linked to the stated scheduled offence to him,” the judgment held.\nOn Section 5 (attachment of property)\nSection 5 is constitutionally valid. It provides a balancing act and shows how proceeds of crime can be traced. \n\"It provides a balancing arrangement to secure the interests of the person as also ensures that proceeds of crime remain available to be dealt with in the manner provided under the Act. The procedural safeguards as delineated are effective measures to protect the interests of persons concerned.\"\nOn Section 24 (reverse burden of proof on accused)\nSection 24 has reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved.\nOn Section 44\nThe proviso in Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 44 of the 2002 Act is to be regarded as directory in nature and this provision is also read down to mean that the Special Court may exercise judicial discretion on case-to-case basis.\nOn Section 45 (twin conditions for bail)\nSection 45 post the amendments is also legal and not unreasonable. \n\"The provision in the form of Section 45 of the 2002 Act, as applicable post amendment of 2018, is reasonable and has direct nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act and does not suffer from the vice of arbitrariness or unreasonableness,\" the judgment said.\nIn this regard, the Court held that its 2017 judgment in Nikesh Tarachand Shah declaring the twin conditions in Section 45(1) of the 2002 Act, as it stood at the relevant time, as unconstitutional in no way obliterated the provision from the statute book.\n\"It was open to the Parliament to cure the defect noted by this Court so as to revive the same provision in the existing form,\" the judgment stated.\nThe Court said that it cannot agree with the observations in Nikesh Tarachand Shah in view of the Constitution Bench decision in Kartar Singh as well as the serious threat posed to the country by money laundering activities.\nRegarding grant of bail, the underlying principle and rigours of Section 45 may apply.\nThe beneficial provision of Section 436A of the Code of Criminal Procedure could be invoked by the accused arrested for offence punishable under the 2002 Act, the Court clarified.\nOn Section 50 (statements by accused to ED) \nThe Court held that statements made by accused to ED officials are not hit by Article 20(3) which lays down rule against self-incrimination.\nIn this regard, the Court held that Section 50 is in the nature of inquiry and ED officials are not police officers. \n\"Section 50 is in nature of inquiry and is not investigation and the authorities are not police officers. The punishment of fine or arrest for giving false information cannot be construed as a compulsion to give statement. The statements are not hit by Article 20,\" the Court said.\nOn Section 63\nSection 63 of the 2002 Act providing for punishment regarding false information or failure to give information does not suffer from any vice of arbitrariness.\nOn inclusion of predicate offences under PMLA schedule\nThe Court held inclusion or exclusion of any particular offence in the Schedule to the 2002 Act is a matter of legislative policy and the nature or class of any predicate offence has no bearing on the validity of the Schedule.\nOn the Enforcement Case Information Report\nIt was found that in view of the special mechanism envisaged by the PMLA, the ECIR could not be equated with an FIR under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).\nThe Court emphasised that the ECIR is an internal document of the ED, and the fact the FIR in respect of scheduled documents has not been recorded does not come in the way of authorities referred to in Section 48 to commence enquiry or initiating civil action of provisional attachment of property.\nFurther, it was stated that supply of a copy of the ECIR to the person concerned, is in every case, is not mandatory.\n\"It is enough, if ED at the time of arrest, discloses the grounds of such arrest.\"\nThis was, however, caveated by saying that when the arrested person is produced before the special court, it would be open to the court to look into the relevant records presented by the authorised representative of ED for answering the issue of need for continued detention.\n\"Even the ED manual is not to be published, being an internal document issued for the guidance of the officials, i.e. ED officials,\" the Court added.\nLawyers who appeared \nSenior Advocates Kapil Sibal, Sidharth Luthra, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Mukul Rohatgi, Amit Desai, S Niranjan Reddy, Menaka Guruswamy, Aabad Ponda, Siddharth Aggarwal, Mahesh Jethmalani, Vikram Chaudhari, Advocates Abhimanyu Bhandari, N Hariharan and Akshay Nagarajan appeared for the petitioners.\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju and Panel Counsel Kanu Agrawal appeared for the Union of India\nBackground\nThe petitioners had questioned various aspects of the law including the wide powers given to ED for search, seizure and attachment, the reverse burden cast on accused to prove innocence, the admissibility of statements made to ED as evidence, the stringent conditions for grant of bail and the impact of predicate offence and its outcome, on PMLA case.\nThe Central government had argued that the offence of money laundering under Section 3 is a standalone offence so long as there is a predicate offence irrespective of whether there is acquittal or conviction in such predicate offence.\nPertinently it was also argued by the government that money laundering under Section 3 is a continuing offence, irrespective of time at which the predicate offence is included in the Schedule.\nRead about the key provisions which were challenged here.\nRead more about petitioners' argument here.\nRead Central government's arguments here."}

However, the Magistrate rejected the application.\nThe petitioner then moved Allahabad High Court and in September 2008, the High Court set aside the Magistrate's order and directed the lodging of a first information report (FIR)\nPursuant to the Court's order, an FIR was registered.\nHowever, the petitioner moved the High Court again alleging that the probe was not being conducted in a fair manner. \nDuring the pendency of the plea, the Uttar Pradesh government, on May 3, 2017, refused to grant prosecution sanction under section 197 of CrPC. As a result, a final report was submitted on May 6, 2017.\nIn February 2018, the High Court, while deciding other issues raised in the case, found no procedural error in the conduct of the investigation, the decision-making process, refusal of prosecution sanction, or any other illegality warranting the court's interference under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Hence, it dismissed the plea.\nThe petitioner then moved the Supreme Court, limiting their arguments to the denial of prosecution sanction by the State Government. The apex court dismissed the plea, noting that the investigation was over, and the closure report had been filed, against which a protest plea was pending before a trial court in Gorakhpur. Notably, the issue of sanction was left open.\nIn November 2022, the trial court rejected the protest plea, stating that the issue related to prosecution sanction had attained finality up to the apex court and could not be revisited. Aggrieved, the petitioner moved the High Court.\nCounsel for the petitioner argued that the question of legality of the order refusing prosecution sanction was left open by the Supreme Court and it could not be said that the issue had attained finality.\nThey also argued that while deciding the protest petition against the closure report, the trial court ought to have decided the legality of the order refusing prosecution sanction.\nOn the other hand, Additional Advocate General Manish Goyal argued that the issue had attained finality and required no adjudication. He also claimed that the petitioner had been indulging in vexatious prosecution of the Chief Minister.\nStating that some forces were working against the Chief Minister to derail the progress of the State, he sought dismissal of the plea. \nThe Court noted that the only question raised by the petitioner before the Supreme Court was regarding the validity of the order refusing prosecution sanction. It held that since the Supreme Court did not answer the issue and dismissed the appeal, the February 2018 judgment of the High Court would prevail.\n\"I find that the trial Court has rightly refused to go into the said question once it got decided by the Supreme Court. Once the question of sanction got finally settled, the trial court could not have taken cognizance on the police report or on the protest petition as the accused, being a public servant, no cognizance could be taken without there being sanction by the competent authority for prosecution,\" the Court said.\nFurther, it observed that once the prosecution sanction was refused, the investigation could not have been carried out by an order under Section 156(3) CrPC and dismissed the plea with costs of ₹1 lakh.\nThe petitioner was represented by Senior Advocate S.F.A.

Even after deboarding from the flight at Frankfurt, the child and her mother were simply made to sit in an ambulance and taken to a hospital directly from the runway, without any representative or officer of the airline accompanying them, or providing them any further instructions or assistance on how to proceed at the hospital,” the Court was told.\nThe parents further submitted that Vistara made no attempt to reach out or offer any assistance to the family after the incident. \n“In fact, Vistara made no contact whatsoever with the family for more than 30 hours after the child and her mother deboarded from the flight. As a result, the child’s parents were constrained to navigate the medical system, arrange for accommodation and make all such other necessary arrangements for their child’s urgent medical treatment in a foreign country, all by themselves. The only time Vistara finally reached out to the family was after Mrs. Gupta was constrained to share details of the incident on her Twitter account, which finally drew the airline’s attention to the incident, but even thereafter, no material assistance or help was extended by the airline to the family while they were in Frankfurt.”\nAdvocates Samar Kachwaha, Shivangi Nanda, Kavita Vinayak, Rini Mehta, Anmol Agarwal and Prayuj Sharma appeared for the plaintiff (family/ parents of the child)."}

A particular service rendered cannot be divided into parts. For the purposes of levy of service tax, the service rendered cannot be dissected like this. The service rendered as a whole by the HGOs to the Haj pilgrims will have to be taken into account,” the court ruled.\nThe top court held that the service is rendered by providing a package for the Haj Pilgrimage to the service recipient who is located in the taxable territory and that is how the service provided by HGOs is taxable for service tax.\nThe apex court clarified that in matters of grant of exemptions in tax matters, latitude has to be given to the decision making.\n“Ultimately, it is also a matter of policy. We have already held that there is a rational basis for classifying specified organisations as a class and keeping out the Private Tour Operators from exemption under Clause 5A. We will have to show judicial self-restraint in this case,” reads the judgment.\nThe top court held that the service is rendered by providing a package for the Haj Pilgrimage to the service recipient who is located in the taxable territory and that is how the service provided by HGOs is taxable for service tax.\nThe apex court clarified that in matters of grant of exemptions in tax matters, latitude has to be given to the decision making.\n“Ultimately, it is also a matter of policy.

However, if the services of a specified organisation in respect of a religious pilgrimage is facilitated by the External Affairs Ministry under bilateral arrangement, the rate would be nil.\nThe petitioners, represented by advocate Haris Beeran, had argued that the journey is also part of the religious ceremony and cannot be separated from the pilgrimage, and is thus eligible for exemption. \nBesides, these amenities are provided in Saudi Arabia and outside the tax regime in India, it was contended. It was also their argument that Haj and Umrah privileges are part of the religious ceremony.\nSenior Counsel Arvind Datar, who also represented the petitioners, had argued that unlike pilgrimages by Hindus to Kashi or Badrinath, Hajj was obligatory for adherents of Islam.\nAfter counsel for the government objected to such references, Justice Khanwilkar had said,\n\"[Such] comparison can draw into debate everything. Being rationalist is part of being Hindu.\"\nDatar had argued that under the existing scheme, tax benefits are only granted to those availing the government quota, while the 30 per cent of others have to pay tax towards facilitating Hajj."}

The said decision was also upheld by the Uttarakhand High Court.\nAggrieved, the appellants preferred the present appeal before the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court noted that the conviction of the appellants was based entirely on the testimonies of two witnesses who had stated that they had last seen the boy with the appellants on October 9, 1999. \nThere was no other evidence adduced either before the trial court or the High Court, which could have proved the guilt of the appellants beyond reasonable doubt, the apex court further noted. \nDisapproving the 'last seen' circumstance as the only basis of conviction of the appellants, the Supreme Court observed:\n\"This court is also of the opinion that apart from the above serious infirmities, there is no evidence, oral or any material object, which connects the appellant-accused with the crime.\"\nMoreover, the Court also highlighted the lapses that the trial court and the High Court had ignored while convicting the appellants for the murder of the deceased boy.\n\"In the present case, save the “last seen” theory, there is no other circumstance or evidence. Importantly, the time gap between when the deceased was seen in the company of the accused on 09-10-1999 and the probable time of his death, based on the post mortem report, which was conducted two days later, but was silent about the probable time of death, though it stated that death occurred approximately two days before the post mortem, is not narrow. Given this fact, and the serious inconsistencies in the depositions of the witnesses, as well as the fact that the FIR was lodged almost 6 weeks after the incident, the sole reliance on the “last seen” circumstance (even if it were to be assumed to have been proved) to convict the accused-appellants is not justified,\" the Court said. \nTherefore, the Court was of the view that conviction order passed by the trial court and later upheld by the High Court was unsustainable in the eyes of law.\nThe appellants were, therefore, acquitted."}

However, the woman conceived and gave birth to her fifth child in the year 2000.\nAfter a long period of time, the woman filed a suit in the year 2005 claiming damages to the extent of ₹1,51,000. \nThe trial court allowed the suit and directed that the woman be granted compensation of ₹51,000. \nThe same was challenged by the State government before the High Court.\nThe High Court opined that the woman had voluntarily approached the primary health centre and had given her consent in writing before undergoing the operation. It noted that the surgery was free of cost and that she never approached the concerned doctor or the health centre informing them about her pregnancy despite the surgery.\n\"Considering the fact that the entire operation firstly was voluntarily undertaken by the plaintiff, secondly she having given consent in writing in this case and thirdly there is no evidence so far as any negligence or lapse on the part of the appellants side or for that matter on the Doctor who had conducted the operation, the judgment and decree of the payment of compensation as damages by the Court below does not seem to be proper, legal and justified,\" the Court ordered.\nTherefore, the bench quashed and set aside the lower court's orders.\nGovernment Advocate Avinash K Mishra represented the State.

While setting aside the death sentence, it may be said that we took counter majority view but constitutional court is to follow the procedure,\" the High Court held.\nThe Court while reading its 108-page judgment observed that every case of rape is a heinous offence, affects supreme honour of the victim and affects public conscience and the present case shocked the public conscience.\nThe bench also observed that Section 376E of the Indian Penal Code was not a substantive offence but merely prescribed punishment. In light of this, the statute had neither prescribed mandatory death penalty nor stated that the accused deserved nothing less than death penalty. \nThey accused will not be entitled to parole or furlough, the Court added.\nThe Court was hearing the reference plea filed by Maharashtra government for confirmation of death sentence against Vijay Jadhav, Mohammed Kasim Bengali, Mohammed Salim Ansari who had been tried for gang rape of the photo journalist in 2013.\nThe convicts themselves had not filed any appeal against their conviction or sentence. \nA year later, in March 2014, Jadhav, Bengali and Ansari were convicted by the Mumbai Sessions Court under Sections 354B (assault), 377 (unnatural offence) and 376D (gang rape) of the Indian Penal Code.\nWhile Khan was sentenced to life imprisonment, the juvenile was sent to a correctional facility after he was convicted by the Juvenile Justice Board.\nThe trio was also awarded with the death sentence by the then Principal Sessions Judge Shalini Phansalkar Joshi after prosecution invoked Section 376E (repeated offenders) of the IPC.\nThey had been convicted in another rape case also committed in the same area on a 19-year-old operator.\nThe trials in both cases went on simultaneously. The three men had been convicted in both cases on the same day. However, the arguments on the quantum of sentence took place before the Sessions Court on the next day, when the prosecution highlighted the conviction which took place in the other case, based on which the trio was awarded death sentence.\nAnsari and Jadhav had earlier approached the High Court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 376E which was upheld by the High Court in 2019.\nSection 376E was added through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, introduced after the gruesome Nirbhaya gang rape case of Delhi in 2012.\nThe Section provides for capital punishment to a repeat offender post conviction for offences punishable under Sections 376, 376A and 376D.\nIn 2021, seven years after being sentenced to death, High Court started hearing the plea by Maharashtra government seeking confirmation of the death sentence.\nAdvocates Yug Mohit Chaudhry and Payoshi Roy argued that the sentence had been handed out based on incorrect application of Section 376E.\nThey submitted that the Section 376E would apply only once a convict has undergone sentence and after an opportunity of reformation has been given to the repeated offender. This did not happen in the present case, Chaudhry submitted.\nChaudhry further submitted that the trial had not been conducted fairly, as the convicts had not been given a fair opportunity to make submissions on framing of charge under Section 376E and the quantum of sentence.\nChaudhry highlighted their impoverished backgrounds and soci-economic conditions which he claimed, prompted them to become violent and commit such an offence.\nThat they were young and had never been subject to any correctional influence earlier in life, it was contended \nIt was, therefore, prayed that the sentence be commuted.\nThe State government on the other hand vehemently opposed the contentions stating that the order of Sessions judge was a deterrent order and was justified.

It shall be duty of the doctor concerned also to mention in detail, the treatment given to the victim of sexual assault including any medicines given or procedure carried out for the purpose of termination of pregnancy,” the Court said.\nJustice Sharma further highlighted the difficulties faced by the courts in reading or making out the observation in the MLCs or discharge summaries due to illegibility of the doctor’s handwriting, medical abbreviations and the terminologies used.\n“Therefore, it is directed that in cases where medical examination of a victim of sexual assault is conducted, all the hospitals concerned will ensure that along with the original MLC as well as discharge summary of such victim, a typed copy of the same is also prepared by the concerned hospital and provided to the investigating officer within a period of one week,\" the judge directed. \nJustice Sharma further ordered the Delhi government and Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to ensure that the existing guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for conducting examination of victims of sexual assault are circulated in all hospitals in the city.\n“The above said Ministries are also directed to circulate the additional directions contained in the present judgment which be added to the existing SOPs, that in case the victim is pregnant and there are orders for medical termination of pregnancy including for preservation of fetus, the investigating officer will place such order before the Superintendent of the hospital concerned, who will ensure that the doctor concerned who is assigned the duty of medical termination of pregnancy conducts the same with utmost caution.”\nThe Court passed these directions while dealing with the bail application filed by a man accused of sexually assaulting a minor girl. \nIt was stated that the accused man used to live near the house of the survivor.

{"id": "id_882", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday opined that the practice of stubble burning by farmers in the northern States of Punjab, Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh should be stopped since it contributes significantly to air pollution in the northern region of the country, including the national capital Delhi.\nStubble burning refers to the practice of farmers setting fire to straw stubble which remain in fields after the harvest of grains like wheat and paddy. The stubble is burnt to prepare the fields for the next set of crops. It is the easiest and cheapest way to clear the fields but leads to drastic dip in air quality.\nA Division Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia expressed concerns about Delhi's continued exposure to hazardous air quality.\nThe Court acknowledged that while stubble burning may not be the sole cause of air pollution, it remains a substantial contributor. \nThe Court, therefore, opined that it must be halted one way or another. Delhi cannot continue in its present state, the Court added. \n\"Stubble burning must go\", Justice Dhulia said.\n\"We are not saying it is the only contributor but it is a substantial one,\" added Justice Kaul.\nAs an interim solution, the Court directed that the local Station House Officer (SHO) be made responsible for addressing stubble burning incidents with oversight from the Chief Secretary of the concerned State.\nThe Court also took note of a suggestion that ethanol could be made with stubble from paddy crops (instead of burning it).\nThe Court was hearing an application in matter concerning various environmental issues. \nIn today's hearing advocate Aparajita Singh referred to a Air Quality Management (AQM) report which highlighted the persistence of fires each year.\nSenior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan emphasized that the timing of the stubble burning may be the primary issue. Further, he stated that paddy should not have been grown in Punjab as it has reduced groundwater levels.\nApart from flagging concerns over stubble burning emissions as a pollutant, the Court also questioned whether the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for paddy should be discontinued. \n\"The crop is destroying the water table of the State. The problem just goes on each year,\" the Court remarked.\nThe Court further noted that while the government was promoting millets on one hand, it was also letting paddy ruin groundwater in the State.\nThe Court proceeded to observe that adherence to the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act was creating problems in the State. It noted that paddy was not native to the State, and that a switch to alternative crops may only occur if Minimum Support Price (MSP) is not given for paddy, aligning with the Central government's aim to encourage the cultivation of traditional crops like millets.\nThe matter will be heard next on November 10."}

They then made various representations starting from the time construction was on but to no avail, which prompted them to move the High Court. \nThe State authorities before the single-judge denied the appellant's contentions, saying that the land was given voluntarily and thus acquired. It pointed out that the appellants had moved the High Court four years after the road construction began. \nRelying on Article 300A, the single-judge noted that there was no material on record to show that the land was handed over voluntarily, and ordered the District Collector to disburse an adequate compensation amount. \nThe Division Bench in appeal said that the burden was on the appellants to prove that they were given assurance of suitable compensation, which they failed to do. It thus set aside the single-judge decision, leading to the present appeal before the Supreme Court. \nThe Supreme Court at the outset noted that there was no dispute that the appellants lost their land and were deprived of their right, title or interest over the land utilised. \n\"The appellants are farmers and the land utilized is agricultural land. It was part of their livelihood. Depriving them of their part of their livelihood and also of their property without authority of law would be violative of Article 21 and Article 300A of the Constitution,\" the Court said. \nArticle 300A, even if not a fundamental right is a constitutional one, and the High Court had erred in shifting the burden to the appellants to prove their lack of voluntary surrender, the Bench observed. \nTaking note of the several representations made, the Supreme Court also ruled that it would be incorrect to say that there was 'substantial delay on part of the appellants in agitating for their rights'.\nNoting that there was nothing on record to show voluntary surrender, the top court stressed that the absence of a compensation scheme as was relied on by the Division Bench, is immaterial. \nOn the Division Bench saying the farmers in question had sought compensation from the wrong authorities, the apex court opined that such a view was too technical. \n\"The Division Bench also proceeded to note that the appellants were keen on changing their stand by initially claiming from the State and then from the Panchayat. This reasoning is also not tenable. The appellants are farmers. They cannot be treated as the persons conversant with intricacies of law. The Division Bench committed an error in commenting against the appellants and drawing an adverse inference. It took a view too technical, to deprive the appellants of their right to compensation.\"\nGiven the mandate of Article 300A, depriving the appellants of compensation is in violation of the Constitution, the Court observed. \n\"Construction/widening of road no doubt would be a public purpose but there being no justification for not paying compensation the action of the respondents would be arbitrary, unreasonable and clearly violative of Article 300-A of the Constitution,\" the Court said.\nTherefore, the appeals were allowed."}

The High Court took the view that since the dead body of the victim was recovered from the room owned by the appellant and he was seen by the PW 3 Priya Kumari locking the door attached to his house, it could be none other than the appellant who could be said to have committed the crime. The High Court completely forgot that there was a co-accused also namely Pritam Tiwari in the picture,\" the Court said.\nThe manner in which the case was handled also prompted the bench to dwell on what defined and constituted a fair trial, and how truth was 'the soul of justice.'\n\"The sole idea of criminal justice system is to see that justice is done. Justice will be said to be done when no innocent person is punished and the guilty person is not allowed to go scot-free. The fair trial is possible only when the court takes active interest and elicit all relevant information and material necessary so as to find out the truth for achieving the ultimate goal of dispensing jusstice with all fairness and impartiality to both the parties,\" the Supreme Court emphasised.\nThe observations came while disposing of an appeal against a 2018 Patna High Court order that had upheld the conviction and death sentence of the accused. The High Court had confirmed a verdict by a Bhagalpur Sessions Court, which led to the appeal before the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court, in turn, found several shortcomings in the decision to convict the accused. \nThis included several discrepancies between the witnesses' accounts of events and the version of the police with regard to the role of the appellant and the co-accused Pritam Tiwari.\n\"The case of all the witnesses before the police was that it was Pritam Tiwari who had come to the house of the victim on the fateful day and date and had taken the victim along with him to his house to watch TV. All the statements further reveal that it was Pritam Tiwari who was found locking the door when the witnesses enquired with Pritam Tiwari about the whereabouts of the victim,\" the Court stated.\nBut neither the counsel for the accused nor the public prosecutor, the trial court judge or the High Court looked into this aspect to try to reach the truth, the bench lamented.\n\"It was the duty of the defence counsel to confront the witnesses with their police statements ... We are sorry to say that the learned defence counsel had no idea how to contradict a witness with his or her police statements in accordance with Section 145 of the Evidence Act, 1872 (for short, ‘Evidence Act’),\" the Supreme Court observed. \nThe bench explained that the public prosecutor ought to have brought to the notice of the witnesses the variances in their statements and confronted them with the same. \nThe top court made it clear that the trial judge was also at fault for having remained a mute spectator. \n\"It was the duty of the presiding officer to put relevant questions to these witnesses in exercise of his powers under Section 165 of the Evidence Act ... Being a case of rape and murder and as the evidence was not free from doubt, the Trial Judge ought to have acquainted himself, in the interest of justice, with the important material and also with what the only important witnesses of the prosecution had said during the police investigation,\" the bench said.\nThe bench pointed out that no forensic laboratory report was collected despite evidence samples having been sent. Further, despite the case being based on circumstantial evidence, the accused was not medically examined.\n\"Who are these senior officers of PW 5 (investigating officer) and why they instructed the PW 5 not to procure the FSL report should have been a subject matter of inquiry by both, the State as well as the trial court. The aforesaid lapse is just a tip of the iceberg. We are at pains to state that it is a very serious flaw on the part of the investigating officer and that too in such a serious matter,\" the Court said. \nThe top court also explained at length how a trial judge can be an active participant in pursuit of ensuring that the truth emerges in a case.\nIt underscored that courts can suo motu look into documents or put questions to witnesses. \nPertinently, High Court can direct further inquiry under Section 367 of the Criminal Procedure Code which it did not, the Supreme Court added.\n\"We regret to state that the High Court completely overlooked the aforesaid aspects as discussed above. What was expected of the High Court to do in such circumstances? If the High Court would have taken little pains to look into the record, then immediately it could have taken recourse to Section 367 of the CrPC,\" the apex court said.\nThe Court proceeded to allow the accused man's appeal and ordered the Patna High Court to hear the matter afresh. \nThe top court also noted that the accused had been behind bars for nine years, most of it being on death row, and hence asked the High Court to dispose of the appeal expeditiously.\nPertinently, the High Court was directed to provide a seasoned criminal lawyer to represent the accused.\nFurther, the Supreme Court registry was directed to send a copy of this ruling to all High Courts, which in turn have to forward it to their respective district courts.\nSenior Advocate Aditya Sondhi appeared for the accused, one Munna Pandey.

Even in MS Dhoni, everybody liked him especially in that film.”\nIn her complaint on the basis of which the FIR was filed, actress Rhea Chakraborty had alleged that the sisters conspired with Dr. Tarun Kumar to obtain a false prescription for administering banned medicines to the late Sushant Singh Rajput.\nChallenging an FIR registered on the basis of this complaint before the Bombay High Court, the sisters claimed that the FIR was lodged to “concoct a whole new story entirely different from the statements made” by Chakraborty before the Supreme Court and media platforms.\nThey sought investigation into the malicious and malafide activities of the Mumbai Police and the Maharashtra government, for which they have sought damages under public law.\nSenior Advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for the sisters, had argued that there was a delay of ninety-one days in filing the FIR, which was not explained by Chakraborty.\nHe had also pointed out that the allegations of prescribing banned medicines were baseless as the medicines could have been prescribed to a patient in the first consultation as per the Telemedicine Practice Guidelines.\nHe submitted that the FIR could not have been registered by the Mumbai Police as the investigation in the Sushant Singh Rajput case had been transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) by the Supreme Court.\nSenior Advocate Devadatt Kamat, appearing for Mumbai Police, highlighted certain evidence that was submitted before the police relating to prescribed medications which created enough doubt to initiate an investigation.\nKamat invited the Court’s attention to the purported prescription and extracts of the WhatsApp chats supplied by Chakraborty to point out that the medicines were being prescribed without online consultation and even appeared in the list of psychotropic substances under the NDPS Act.\nTo justify the delay in filing of FIR, Advocate Satish Maneshinde argued that after Rajput’s prescription was leaked on social media, Chakraborty realised that the medicines were bought through these prescriptions. On realising that the medicines could have been a cause for his death, she immediately approached the police.\nShe approached the Mumbai Police because she could not have filed a complaint with the CBI, Maneshinde argued.\nIt was further contended that Chakraborty’s FIR brought forth a different chain of events than what was being claimed by Rajput’s family and those circumstances should be examined as it could give answers to the cause of the actor's death."}

Necessary steps will have to be taken if the concerned authorities are failing in their duties. If the structural conditions of the schools are dilapidated, it would not only involve physical risk to these students, but a congenial atmosphere for imparting education would be missing,” the Court recorded, in its order passed earlier this month. \nThe bench directed constitution of a committee in each district across the State which would comprise the following members: \nThe principal district judge;\nThe district collector;\nThe education officer in Zilla Parishad (secretary);\nExecutive engineer of the Public Works Department, as someone having expertise for evaluation of the structural stability of such schools;\nDistrict Superintendent of Police, to ensure law and order.

Visits of administrative judges to the district for the purpose of inspection sometimes breeds terror in the hearts of our district judiciary.

They (plot-holders and landowners), therefore, made an offer that if the landowners are permitted to retain the said land, they are willing to transfer another piece of land of the same or near about the same area. We find the said request to be reasonable. We, therefore, permit the landowners/plot holders to make a representation to the Municipal Council ... We pass the above directions under Article 142 of the Constitution of India in order to protect the trees that are aged 100 years or older\", the Court stated.\nA bench of Justices BR Gavai and SVN Bhatti issued the direction while setting aside a July 2019 Bombay High Court order in the case.\nThe High Court had partially allowed a challenge to a government notification converting the area from a 'no-development' zone to a residential zone.\nThe Shirdi Nagar Panchayat (municipal council) challenged the High Court order, by which the authority was allowed only to develop the area for the limited purpose of the 'residential enjoyment' of the plot owners. \nOn the other hand, the municipal council sought to take over a part of the land in question to develop a swimming pool and an indoor game hall. \nThe council pointed out that as per a 2004 government notification, one of the conditions for converting the area into a residential zone was that a part of the land would be surrendered to the government as an open space and amenity space. \nThe Supreme Court found merit in some of the authority's contentions. \nAmong other aspects, the top court faulted the landowners for their delay in moving the High Court for relief. It noted that the landowners had moved the High Court 14 years after the government notification. \nFurther, the top court also noted that the landowners and plot holders had already taken advantage of the 2004 notification for the conversion of the land to a residential zone, which came with conditions to hand over a part of the land for developing public utility facilities. \nMoreover, the judges found that they had moved the High Court only after they failed to secure relief in earlier rounds of civil litigation. \nThey were, thus, hit by the doctrines of election (a party cannot avail two remedies at the same time) and approbation and reprobation (taking contrary stances in the same case), the Supreme Court observed. \nIf authorities allow land or plot owners to develop land in exchange for a part of the land to be given free of cost for a public utility purpose, the same cannot be held to be illegal, the top court added.\nThus, the Supreme Court allowed the municipal council's appeal. \nHowever, the land and plot holders were allowed to request the authority to use another piece of land to develop the proposed amenity facilities in order the protect the 100-year-old trees rooted in the disputed site. \n\"On such an application being made, the Municipal Council would consider the same in accordance with law,\" the Court ordered. \nAdvocate Sanjay Kharde appeared for the Shirdi Nagar Panchayat.

The grounds raised by the applicant may be - a. a reasonable and immediate threat to life, personal liberty and bodily harm in the jurisdiction where the FIR is registered; b. the apprehension of violation of right to liberty or impediments owing to arbitrariness; c. the medical status/ disability of the person seeking extraterritorial limited anticipatory bail\nThe bench stressed the importance of the concerned court ascertaining the territorial proximity, and 'exceptional and compelling circumstances', when granting anticipatory bail.\n\"Power to grant extra-territorial anticipatory bail should be exercised ... where, denying transit anticipatory bail or interim protection to enable the applicant to make an application under Section 438 of CrPC before a Court of competent jurisdiction would cause irremediable and irreversible prejudice to the applicant. The Court ... in case it deems fit may grant interim protection instead for a fixed period and direct the applicant to make an application before a Court of competent jurisdiction.\"\nFurther, it cautioned against forum shopping and clarified that accused cannot travel to any other State solely for filing bail pleas without clear reasons.\nThe issue before the apex court was whether anticipatory bail can be granted by a court which is not located within the State where the FIR was lodged.\nThe top court had in March this year issued notice on the plea filed by a complainant who had lodged a first information report (FIR) in Rajasthan, but the accused-husband was granted anticipatory bail by a Bengaluru district judge.\nThe complaint involved allegations of dowry demands.\nSenior Advocate Kaustav Paul, appearing for the woman, pointed out that different High Courts have taken divergent views in the matter and the apex court needs to settle the position of law.\nThe woman's plea was filed through advocate Rishi Malhotra.\nWith respect to the original complaint, the top court set aside the order of the Bengaluru court for not taking note of the views of the complainant.\n\"However, in the interest of justice, it is directed that no coercive steps may be taken against the accused for the next four weeks, to enable them to approach the jurisdictional Court in Chirawa, Rajasthan for anticipatory bail\", it was clarified.\nAdditional Solicitor General Vikramjit Banerjee was the Amicus Curiae.\nAdditional Advocate General Manish Singhvi appeared for the Rajasthan government.

However, the husband made several attempts to reconcile but in vain.\n\"It seems that the wife belongs to higher strata in their society in respect of financial status comparatively than the husband, hence, she wants to live with him but not along with her in-laws.

{"id": "id_970", "reference_summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that consumption of alcohol in a private place without causing nuisance to others will not attract any offence under law [Salim Kumar v. State of Kerala & Ors.].\nSingle judge Justice Sophy Thomas also said that mere smell of alcohol also cannot be construed to mean that the person was intoxicated or was under the influence of liquor.\n\"Consuming liquor in a private place without causing nuisance or annoyance to anybody will not attract any offence. Mere smell of alcohol also cannot be construed to mean that the person was intoxicated or was under the influence of any liquor,\" the Court said. \nThe Court, therefore, quashed the proceedings initiated against the petitioner under the Kerala Police Act.\nTo arrive at its conclusion, the Court referred to the definition of intoxication as per Black's Law dictionary which says:\n\"A diminished ability to act with full mental and physical capabilities because of alcohol or drug consumption; drunkenness.\"\nThe order was passed on a petition moved by a village officer to quash the criminal case against him for offences punishable under Section 118(a) of the Kerala Police Act (the KP Act).\nThe petitioner, represented by advocates IV Pramod, KV Sasidharan and Saira Souraj, submitted that he had been invited to the police station for identifying an accused where, upon not being able to identify the accused the police had foisted a \"false case\" against him.\nSection 118 (a) of KP Act, under which the petitioner was booked, reads as follows:\n“118. Penalty for causing grave violation of public order or danger:- Any person who.-(a) “is found in a public place, in an intoxicated manner or rioting condition or incapable of looking after himself----”\nThe Court expanded on the scope of this section by analysing it in three distinct parts:\nIntoxicated in a public place : A diminished ability to act with full mental and physical capabilities because of alcohol or drug consumption can be considered intoxication but merely having consumed alcohol in a private place won't constitute an offence under the KP Act.\nRioting condition: The behaviour which is violent/ uncontrolled, which is contrary to law, which may tend to disturb the sense of morality of the public or which may affect the public peace or decorum may be termed as riotous or disorderly behaviour. \nIncapable of looking after himself: Weakening of self control and self awareness, incapacity to know or realise the consequences of actions, incoherent speech, unsteady gait, staggering etc. and the manner in which he conducts himself towards fellow men are relevant factors to ascertain capability of taking care of ones self.\nConsidering the instant case on merits, the Court noted that the only allegation in the FIR was that he was intoxicated and unable to control himself. \nMoreover, all the witnesses are police officers except one, who was the accused that the petitioner had been brought into the police station to identify.\nThe Court opined that the very fact that the petitioner reached the police station, when he was asked to be present there, itself will negative the case of the prosecution that he was incapable of looking after himself even if it is taken for argument sake that he had consumed alcohol at that time.\n\"Even if it is taken for argument sake that the petitioner had consumed alcohol, the available facts and materials are not sufficient to suggest that, he was not able to control himself or he committed rioting inside the Police Station causing nuisance. He reached Police Station, only because he was asked to be present there. Prosecution has no case that the petitioner is having any criminal antecedents.\" the Court observed.\nIt accordingly quashed the proceedings against the petitioner."}
{"id": "id_974", "reference_summary": "The Kerala High Court recently held that a doctor can be held liable for medical negligence only if the patient died as a direct or proximate result of the doctor's acts, and not simply because things went wrong due to mischance or misfortune [Philip Thomas and Ors. v State of Kerala Ors.].\nJustice Kauser Edappagath observed that every patient death cannot be termed medical negligence. \nThere should be sufficient evidence to accuse a medical professional of such negligence. The death should be a \"direct or proximate result\" of the negligent act alleged to attract criminal liability, the Court explained. \nPertinently, a mere accident, an untoward incident or an error of judgment cannot be termed negligence per se, the Court said.\n“A medical professional cannot be held liable simply because things went wrong from mischance or misfortune. A mere deviation from normal professional practice is not necessarily negligence. Nor could mere accident or untoward incident be termed negligence, also an error of judgment is not negligence per se,\" stated the judgment. \nDoctors are volunteers who take the risk of dealing with “the most intricate, delicate, and complex machine on earth – the human body”, the judge highlighted. \nAny medical intervention on such a “highly compound” machine carries inherent risks and there is always a chance that the medical treatment does not go as planned, it was observed.\n“When things go wrong, it is not always the fault of the doctor. A complication by itself does not constitute negligence. There is a big difference between an adverse or untoward event and negligence. However, there is a growing tendency to accuse the doctor of an adverse or untoward event,” the judge further noted.  \nHe proceeded to emphasise that while dealing with medical negligence cases, courts should strike a careful balance between the doctor’s autonomy to make judgments and the rights of the patient, while also recognising the complexity of the human body, the inexactness of medical science and genuine scope of errors of judgment.\n“However, while dealing with criminal prosecution for medical negligence, the trial courts often ignore these principles. The subject matter of these appeals is one such typical case,” the High Court noted.\nThe Court clarified that in order to convict a medical professional for medical negligence, the prosecution must prove culpable and gross negligence beyond a reasonable doubt. It should be shown that the doctor did or failed to do something which no ordinary skilled medical professional would have done or failed to do, the judge explained. \nThe Court also noted that there is a growing tendency among the public to accuse medical practitioners after adverse and unfortunate events, causing professional damage and emotional drain for such medical practitioners.\n“Nothing can be more professionally damaging and emotionally draining than being arrayed as an accused in any such action. A surgeon, under fear of facing criminal prosecution in the event of failure for whatever reason – whether due to his fault or not- cannot perform at his best,” the court underscored.\nThe Court was considering appeals filed by five medical professionals (two doctors and three nurses) against a trial court order convicting them under Sections 304A (causing death by negligence) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe case concerned the death of a 37-year-old woman who died after a sterlisation procedure by laparoscopy in 2006. After the surgery, she developed respiratory complications and was put under oxygen support. Even though she was shifted to a different hospital for expert management, she passed away. \nThereafter, her uncle filed a medical negligence case against the medical team that was involved in her operation.\nThe lower court sentenced the accused to undergo simple imprisonment for one year for the offense under Section 304 of the IPC and simple imprisonment for three months for the offense under section 201 of the IPC. This prompted the accused to approach the High Court in appeal. \nThe High Court, after examining the material on record, concluded that the medical professionals had done their best to save the life of the deceased and that there was no material to suggest that any of the alleged lapses in the pre-operative or post-operative management of the patient were the direct or proximate cause of death.\nThe Court, therefore, concluded that the medical negligence case would not stand against the accused. \n “No doubt, this is an unfortunate case. But simply because a patient has not favorably responded to a treatment or a surgery has failed, the doctor cannot be held negligent per se for the offense under section 304A of IPC unless the prosecution establishes beyond reasonable doubt the culpable and gross negligent act on his part. That act must be the proximate or direct cause of death of the patient. Such a shred of evidence is lacking in this case. None of the witnesses and documents discussed in the above paragraphs points out gross or culpable negligence on the part of any accused,” the Court said.\nThe Court found that the offence under Section 201 of IPC was not made out against the accused after observing that the mere failure to maintain surgery notes, nurses’ notes, or case sheets properly could not be construed as intentional or amount to causing the disappearance of evidence.\nHence, the High Court set aside the trial court conviction in the case and acquitted the appellant-medical practitioners."}

She knew pretty well that she cannot enter into a lawful marriage with the petitioner, in as much as she is a married woman. Recently this Court in XXX Vs. State of Kerala [2022 KHC 296] has held that the promise alleged to have been made by the accused to a married woman that he could marry her is a promise which is not enforceable in law. Such an unenforceable and illegal promise cannot be a basis for the prosecution under Section 376 of IPC. Here, no question of promise to marry arise, since, the victim is a married woman and she knew that legal marriage with the petitioner was not possible under the law,” the order said\nThe Court was considering a petition filed by the accused to quash all the criminal proceedings pending against him for offences under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 417 (punishment for cheating), and 493 (cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). \nAccording to the first information statement, both the accused and the victim, who are natives of India. had met through Facebook in Australia. The said relationship developed into a love affair and they decided to marry. But the marriage did not take place. In the meanwhile, on two occasions they had consensual sexual intercourse.\nDuring the relevant period, the woman was still married though separated from her husband and divorce proceedings were still going on.\nThe prosecution case was that the accused after giving a false promise of marriage, sexually assaulted the woman on several occasions and, thereby, committed the offence of rape.\nThe Court noted that it was evident from the first information statement that the sexual intercourse was consensual in nature. The woman consented to sex persuaded by the promise of marriage given by the petitioner. \n“It is settled that if a man retracts his promise to marry a woman, consensual sex they had would not constitute an offense of rape under Section 376 of IPC unless it is established that consent for such sexual act was obtained by him, by giving false promise of marriage with no intention of being adhered to and that promise made was false to his knowledge,” the order said\nThe Court noted that the basic ingredients of Section 376 of the IPC are not attracted since the woman knew that the promise cannot be enforced since she was a married woman.\n\"An unenforceable and illegal promise cannot be a basis for the prosecution under Section 376 of IPC. Here, no question of promise to marry arise, since, the victim is a married woman and she knew that legal marriage with the petitioner was not possible under the law,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also held that and there was nothing on record to attract the ingredients of Sections 417 and 493 of the IPC. \nTherefore, the Court quashed the case against the accused on the ground that a man’s promise to marry an already married woman would not attract provisions of rape under Section 376.\nThe petitioner was represented by advocate Mahesh V Ramakrishnan. The respondent was represented by Public Prosecutor Sangeetha Raj."}

Concerned parties, have to come personally before the Court from wherever they are residing, including from villages, thus incurring tremendous hardships for the parties concerned, apart from travelling expenses, litigation expenses and staying expenses in the city. Parties, if working, are required to take a day off,\" the bench noted.  \nApart from the hardships caused to parties, the bench said that if Section 498A is made compoundable with the permission of the concerned court hearing the case, precious time of the High Court can be saved. \nThe High Court noted that the State of Andhra Pradesh had made Section 498A compoundable way back in 2003.\n\"We direct the registry to forward a copy of this order to the Additional Solicitor General, for taking necessary steps or action and to enable him to take up the issue before the concerned Ministry, at the earliest,\" the bench ordered. \nThe bench was hearing a petition wherein three members of a family had approached Justice Dere's bench to quash the proceedings under Section 498A. \nThe bench noted that the three petitioners lived in three different and far off districts - Pune, Satara and Navi Mumbai and were compelled to travel all the way to Mumbai to attend the proceedings as they had to remain personally present for the hearing. \nThe bench quashed the FIR lodged against the applicants in Pune's Hadapsar police station given the amicable settlement between the complainant woman and her in-laws. It noted that the woman has agreed to get the FIRs quashed after she was paid ₹10 lakh out of the total ₹25 lakh alimony. \nHowever, the bench noted that a large number of petitions are filed daily in the High Court, seeking quashing of Section 498A along with other compoundable offences after parties reach an amicable settlement. \n\"It is immaterial, whether the parties have reconciled or have amicably resolved their disputes and entered into consent terms, the fact remains, that to quash the proceeding, parties are required to file applications or writ petitions in this Court, are required to remain present in this High Court, and to file affidavits and give proof of their identity,\" the bench observed. \nThe bench, therefore, sought assistance from Advocate General (AG) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, who informed that the State had in July 2018 passed a bill to compound the offence under Section 498A, in both its houses. The bill, the AG said, was sent for President's assent and as per protocol, the office of the President forwarded the bill to the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development for its comments. \nThe Union ministry, the AG said responded that \"diluting the offence would not be in the interest of the victim\" and, therefore, the State had replied with a clarification for its move to compound the offence. However, the ministry is yet to respond to the clarification, it was stated.\nThe bench further noted that the Law Commission in its 237th and 243rd reports had recommended compounding of the said offence. \nIt further took into account the fact that the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) 2020 report, shows that a total of 1,11,549 cases were registered under 498A in 2020. \n\"Of these, 5,520 were closed by Police citing as false and overall 16,151 cases were closed by police either because they were false or there was a mistake of fact or law or it was a civil dispute etc. That is 14.4% of cases were closed by police for not finding merit in the case. Around 96,497 men, 23,809 women were arrested under 498A, making total arrests under this section of 1,20,306 persons. A total of 18,967 cases were tried in courts of which 14,340 led to acquittal and 3,425 led to conviction,\" the bench noted from the data. \nThe data further revealed that around 6,51,404 were pending for trial in 2020 alone. \nThe bench opined that despite the law commission reports, the NCRB data, the judgments of courts recommending a relook at the provision, the offence under Section 498A continues to be non-compoundable. \nTherefore, it ordered ASG Anil Singh to get instructions from the Union ministry for the same. It would next hear the matter on December 19. \nAdvocate Datta Mane appeared for the Petitioners. \nAdvocate Akash Yadav appeared for the Complainant. \nAdditional Public Prosecutor JP Yagnik represented the State."}

However, the child expressed his willingness to meet his elder siblings, who have been living with their father and are presently in the United States.  \n\"Due to the bitterly fought litigation between the parents, the child was deprived of having the company of his father and elder siblings. For the healthy growth of a child, it is necessary that a child has the company of both his parents as well as his siblings,\" the order stated. \nThe Bench also took into account the bitterly fought litigation between the father and the mother of the child in question for over several years now. It noted that initially, the child showed unwillingness to meet the father, but later tried to connect with him on a Zoom call. \n\"It is in his interest that he has the company of both his parents. It is also in his interest that the scars in his mind due to the unfortunate incidents in the past are washed out.

It added that both the parents should express some regret and take this as an opportunity to adopt corrective measures and help him wash out the scars in his mind.\nThe Bench further observed that matrimonial disputes are fought bitterly in India and that children have to face the consequences of such bitter litigation.\n\"This is an unfortunate case where due to a bitterly fought matrimonial dispute between the parents, the children have suffered. In our country, matrimonial disputes constitute the most bitterly fought adversarial litigation. A stage comes when warring couples stop seeing reasons.
