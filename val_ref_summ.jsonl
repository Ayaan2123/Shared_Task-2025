{"id": "id_1010", "reference_summary": "The Allahabad High Court recently observed that while it is known for having the highest pendency of cases, it is seldom mentioned that each of its judges decides the maximum number of cases each year in India [Banwari Lal Kanchhal v. State of UP].\nJustice Subhash Vidyarthi made the comment while rejecting a lawyer’s request for passing over a case on the ground that the counsel was busy in some other court.\n\"The Allahabad High Court is generally talked about for its highest pendency, which at the start of this day was 10,60,451, out of which, 4,96,876 cases are of criminal nature. It is seldom mentioned that the average number of cases decided per Judge of this Court per year is the maximum in the Country,\" he observed.\nHighlighting the ever-increasing workload on judges, he added that not less than 150 matters are listed before a bench on any given day, several of which cannot be taken up due to paucity of time. \n“The practice of passing over the matters due to engagement of the learned Counsel elsewhere has also played its bit in increasing pendency of the cases as every such request consumes at least a minute or two.\"\nJustice Vidyarthi said that while judges are trying to reduce the pendency by enhancing the speed of dispensation of justice, they cannot do so without the fullest cooperation of the advocates.\nThe Court said that lawyers should decrease the number of requests for adjournments and not object to the submissions being heard in their absence, particularly when there is a counsel present in the courtroom to take notes on the submissions. \nIt also opined that its \"precious time\" could also be better utilized if counsel refrained from citing multiple case-laws on a single point. \n“The same old practices will continue to produce the same old results but as the society needs faster disposal of matters, all of us should change our practices to produce better results,” Justice Vidyarthi added.\nThe official data on disposal of cases before High Courts does reveal that the Allahabad High Court decides the most cases each year.\nBelow is the data on High Courts that usually dispose of more than 1 lakh cases each year:\nThe data was provided by the Ministry of Law & Justice in response to a parliamentary question posed by Rajya Sabha member TG Venkatesh. \nHowever, the Allahabad High Court's annual Case Clearance Rate (CCR) - calculated on the basis of the number of cases disposed of in a year compared to the number of cases filed in that year - is not highest among the High Courts.\nWhile some of the High Courts dispose of over 100 per cent (more than number of cases filed a year) cases each year, the Allahabad High Court over the years has fluctuated between 77 per cent and 98 per cent.\nThe case before the Court concerned an application for stay on the conviction of former Rajya Sabha member Banwari Lal Kanchhal, who was recently held guilty of beating up and threatening a Sales Tax Officer in 1991. His sentence of two years of imprisonment was suspended earlier.\nThe Court also took note of the fact that the trial court, while imposing the sentence on the Kanchhal, had turned down his request for granting him the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act, 1958. \nThe trial court was of the view that if Kanchhal were given the benefit of probation, the public would feel that the judiciary was aiding such famous persons. By punishing such famous persons, a sense of fear of the criminal justice system will be instilled in the public and the people’s faith in the judiciary will increase, the trial court had opined.\nHowever, the High Court called such reasoning “extraneous” and held that a person cannot be denied the benefit of statutory provisions merely with the object of improving the social image of the judiciary.\n“While deciding any case, the Court has to primarily keep into mind all the relevant facts and circumstances of the case and the relevant provisions of law. The opinion of the public should not influence the decision of a Judge,\" the Court said.\nConcluding that Kanchhal had strong chances of success in his appeal against the order of conviction and sentence, the High Court proceeded to stay his conviction.\nSenior Advocate Jaideep Narain Mathur and Advocates Amit Jaiswal, Nadeem Murtaza and Mohit Singh represented Kanchhal.\nGovernment Advocate VK Singh appeared for the State.\nAdvocates Vijay Dixit and Devam Shukla appeared on behalf of certain intervenors."}

In the present case, it was argued that the authors of original works were entitled to royalties on each occasion a sound recording was communicated to the public by the radio channels. \nThe defendant companies, Rajasthan Patrika and Music Broadcast Limited, were engaged in the business of operating FM Tadka and Radio City respectively. They claimed that the amendments did not grant any new substantive right to the authors of original works. \nThe Court concluded that IPRS was justified in claiming interim relief due to changes to the Copyright Act. It agreed with IPRS’ argument that the addition of provisos to Sections 17 and 18 (owner and assignment of copyright) brought about a change leading to recognition of additional rights in favour of authors of original literary and musical works. \n“There is substance in the contention raised on behalf of IPRS that in a given situation, even a proviso can give rise to a substantive right in favour of a party,” the order stated. \nSenior Advocates Ravi Kadam, Janak Dwarkadas and Ashish Kamat with Advocates Rohan Kadam, Himanshu Bagai, Thomas George, Tanvi Sinha, Navankur Pathak, Neeti Nihal and Roma Liya briefed by Saikrishna and Associates appeared for IPRS. \nAdvocates Abhishek Malhotra, Sapna Chaurasia and Darshit Jain briefed by TMT Law Practice appaared for Rajasthan Patrika. \nSenior Advocate Virendra Tulzapurkar with Advocates Hiren Kamod and Rahul Jain briefed by Alpha Chambers appeared for Music Broadcast."}

Governor is not entitled to enter the political arena and play a role in intra-party to inter-party dispute. He cannot act on the basis that some members want to leave the Shiv Sena,\" the Bench said in its judgment.\nPertinently, the Bench pointed out that there is a difference between the government losing majority and MLAs of incumbent government being unhappy. \nThe dissatisfaction of members is a subjective factor and the same should not have been been relied on by the Governor to call a floor test, the Bench emphasised. Instead, objective criteria ought to have been relied on. \n\"Among 34 MLAs who signed the resolution a few were also ministers and governor concluded that members want to leave the political party... The governor had no objective material on the basis of which he could doubt the objective of the incumbent govt and the dissatisfaction of some members is not enough to call the floor test and he must use objective criteria and not use subjective satisfaction. Even if it is assumed that MLAs wanted to leave the govt... it was only dissatisfaction portrayed... floor test cannot be used as a medium to solve a intra party difference or inter party differences,\" the judgment of the constitution bench said. \nAs such, former Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari was wrong to call a floor test was wrong, the Bench concluded. \n\"Governor was wrong to conclude that Uddhav Thacheray had lost majority. Lack of security is not a reason to conclude that a govt has fallen and it was nothing but an extraneous reason to be relied upon by the governor. The discretionary power of governor under article 163 is for explicit stated subjects in the constitution,\" the Bench held.\nHowever, the Bench concluded that even though the Governor was wrong in ordering floor test, since Thackeray did not face the test and instead, resigned, nothing can be done and status quo cannot be restored. Therefore, the Shinde government can continue.\nThe case has its genesis in the split of the Shiv Sena into two factions, one led by Thackeray and the other by Shinde, who went on to replace the former as Maharashtra's Chief Minister in June 2022.\nOn February 17 this year, the Election Commission (EC) had recognised the Shinde faction as the real Shiv Sena based on the majority in the Maharashtra Assembly. The Shinde faction has 40 MLAs in the Assembly as against the Thackeray faction's 15.\nThe issues on which arguments were advanced in the course of the hearings included:\nValidity of the decision of former Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to ask former Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to face a floor test.\nValidity of Governor's decision to ask rebel faction leader Eknath Shinde to take oath as Chief Minister.\nPower of the Speaker to act under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution and whether he could be incapacitated from acting under anti-defection law if a notice seeking his removal from the office is pending.\nWhich faction of a political party can claim to be the real political party in case of a split within the MLAs (legislative wing) of the political party.\nWhether 2016 Supreme Court judgment by a five-judge Constitution Bench in the Nabam Rebia case (relating to the 2016 political crisis in Arunachal Pradesh) which had ruled that a Speaker stands disabled to act under the Tenth Schedule to curb defection, requires to be revisited and referred to a seven-judge bench.\nRead more about the judgment of the Constitution Bench and how it dealt with these issues here."}

Thereafter, on August 17, the Court received the medical report which indicated that the injuries were a result of physical assault.\nThe Additional Commissioner of Police after reviewing mobile and video recordings collected from independent witnesses, concluded that an altercation over motorcycle parking led to Rajat Bajpai being taken by police personnel to the police station. \nIt was also opined that because of the petitioner sitting on Dharna on the road and being forcibly taken in a police vehicle, the victim received injuries on his legs due to friction/ skirmish.\nNonetheless, the Court found the opinion provided by the Additional Commissioner of Police unsatisfactory as there was contrast between the medical reports, which indicated injuries caused by a solid and blunt item, and the contention of physical assault.\n“Friction cannot cause contusion as has been reported by the two medical officers concerned,” the Court said while rejecting the argument of the Additional Commissioner of Police.\nFurther, the Additional Commissioner of Police has not expressed any opinion at all about the possibility of these two constables beating up the petitioner, the Court noted.\n\"He has only stated that it was not proper for them to have taken out the petitioner,” the Court said.\nAdditionally, the Court noted that the constables were not individually included as respondents in the present petition.

{"id": "id_1036", "reference_summary": "The Allahabad High Court recently held that individuals have the fundamental right to change their names as per their personal preference and this right comes within the scope of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. \nIn an order passed on May 25, single-judge Justice Ajay Bhanot observed that a name is of universal human value and a cherished right across jurisdictions. \n“The intimacy of human life and a person’s name is undeniable. The right to keep a name of choice or change the name according to personal preference comes within the mighty sweep of the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The importance of a name is an universal human value and a cherished right across jurisdictions. The fundamental right to keep or change a name is vested in every citizen by virtue of Article 19(1)(a) and Article 21 of the Constitution of India. But it is not an absolute right and is subject to various reasonable restrictions as may be prescribed by law,” the Court said. \nIt, therefore, set aside an order of the Regional Secretary, Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad of Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, which had rejected an application by a man seeking change of his name in the high school and intermediate certificates.\nThe man's name was recorded as 'Shahnawaz' in the board of high school examination certificate and the intermediate examination certificate. \nHe later changed his name to 'Md Sameer Rao' and the same was published in the gazette. \nHe then made an application for change of his name in his schools certificates. The said application was declined by the State education board and this was challenged before the High Court.\nThe Court observed that the application was rejected by the board citing restrictions under Regulations 40(ख) and 40 (ग) framed under the UP Intermediate Education Act.\nUnder Regulation 40(ख), the application for change of name shall be entertained only if the name is gross or sounds offensive, or appears to be derogatory. \nAs per Regulation 40 (ग), applications seeking to adopt nick names, names disclosing a person’s religion or caste or use of honorific word or a title will not be accepted.\nThe High Court observed that for the purpose of change of name, the students appearing in different education boards across the country comprised one class.\nWhile the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) bye-laws do not contain any restrictions as imposed in the Regulations, the Court deduced that students from UP Board were treated deferentially and discriminated against as regards their right to change of name. \n“This constitutes violation of right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The restrictions contained in Regulation 40 (ग) are disproportionate and fail the test of reasonable restrictions on fundamental rights under Articles 19(1)(a), 21 and 14 of the Constitution of India. They are arbitrary and infringe the fundamental right to choose and change own’s name vested by virtue of the Constitution of India,” the judge emphasiesd. \nIn view of the same, the court read down Regulation 40 (ग).\nWith this the court also noted that the petitioner’s new name gave him a higher sense of self worth, and was within the scope of Regulation 40. \nIn light of this, the court set aside the regional secretary’s order and directed that the application of the petitioner to change his name from “Shahnawaz” to “Md Sameer Rao” be allowed.\nHence, fresh high school and intermediate certificates incorporating the said change should be issued, the judgment said."}

Fanaticism, in any form, is to be condemned, if it is exhibited. Linguistic fanaticism is more dangerous as it would give an impression that one language alone is superior and being imposed upon the people speaking different languages,” the Court added.\nIn this backdrop, the Court also expressed appreciation for the Central government’s recognition of the importance of one’s mother tongue or language in the National Education Policy.\n\"When such is the importance given to the languages of the country, it seems that a few officials in the Respondent Government either without understanding the sensitivity of the issue or by inadvertence, are bent upon using Hindi in communications and other official matters,” the Court said.\nWith respect to the present case, the Court also referred to Section 8 of the Official Languages Act, 1963 which excluded the application of the Official Languages Rules, 1976 in the State of Tamil Nadu, thereby making it clear the Central government is expected to use English for official communications with Tamil Nadu.\n\"To put it in other words, the official language of India (Hindi) cannot be used for official correspondence with the State of Tamil Nadu. When the Act of Parliament states about the use of English language for official purpose of communication between the Union and the States which have not adopted Hindi as their official language, the Central Government is duty bound to follow the enactment,\" the Court observed.\nThe Court further noted that Article 350 of the Constitution of India entitles any person to submit a representation to Union or the State government in any of the languages used in the Union or State.\nPertinently, the Bench went on to express hope that the Central government will seriously consider amending Article 350 so that, replies given to such representations are also given the in the language used.\n“If a representation is given as per Article 350 of the Constitution, reply should be given in the same language, so that, the people could understand the information. This Court hopes that the Central Government would seriously consider to amend Article 350, so that, not only representation is given in the languages of the Union or the States, but also reply is given in the same language used by the citizens,” the Court said.\nAs far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, the Court remarked,\n“The Government of Tamil Nadu passed the Official Languages Act, by which, only two language formula is being adopted viz., Tamil and English. Therefore, the Central Government is also expected to respect the sentiments of the people. It would be appropriate and it is expected that the Central Government gives its reply to the citizens, in their respective language as stated in Article 350.\"\nThe Bench was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by Lok Sabha Member of Parliament from Madurai, Su Venkatesan who approached the Court after he received a reply from the Central government in Hindi to a representation made by him in English.\nVenkatesan told the Court that he had written back to the Union government, calling for the reply to be sent again in English.\nHowever, upon failing to receive any response to this additional communication, he moved the Court. His petition had urged the Court to direct the use of English in all communications between the Central government and the State of Tamil Nadu.\nBefore the High Court, the Central government admitted that there was a mandate to use English in communications between the Centre and States that have not adopted Hindi as their official language.\nAppearing for the Centre, Assistant Solicitor General L Victoria Gowri further submitted that the reply to Venkatesan had been inadvertently written in Hindi. There was no intention on the part of the Central government to violate any provision of the Official Languages Act, 1963 or Rules, the Court was told.\nThe Court, however, was not convinced that it was a bona fide error on the Centre’s part. The Bench opined that if the mistake had really been inadvertent, the Central government would have immediately replied to Venkatesan in English after the issue was raised.\n“This Court is of the firm view that the first Respondent would not have sent the reply dated 07.11.2020 along with English version, if the notice was not ordered by this Court. The regret letter dated 07.11.2020 has been belatedly given only to avoid any adverse orders from this Court. Therefore, the reason given on 07.11.2020 by the first Respondent cannot be bonafide,” the Court said.\nThe Court also observed that there were other instances reported where the Centre had only responded in Hindi to the State of Tamil Nadu.\n“It is available in public domain that information sought by the people of non Hindi speaking States, especially, from Tamil Nadu, is given only in Hindi … When a right is given under Article 19 (1) of the Constitution regarding freedom to write and freedom of expression, it is the duty of the Central Government to use English. People from various States would feel very happy, if the communications are given in their own language, whereas the Central Government has confined only to English and Hindi,” the Court said.\nCommenting on the importance of communicating in the vernacular as well, the Court noted that even notifications prior to land acquisitions have to mandatorily be communicated in the vernacular.\n“The purpose of publication in vernacular languages is only to see that the information regarding cases reaches the local people, particularly, the land owners who are likely to be affected,” the Court said.\nWith these observations, the Court proceeded to allow the petition, while cautioning the Union government and its officers and instrumentalities to follow the provisions of Official Languages Act 1963 and the Official Languages Rules 1976.\nHindi cannot be used by Centre for official correspondence with Tamil Nadu: Madras High Court#MadrasHC #TamilNadu #Hindi Read more here: https://t.co/BJj7EvuQTH pic.twitter.com/c4lt7xX5aM"}

Dr Sarin subsequently challenged the Magistrate order.\nGranting a breather to the surgeon, the Additional Sessions Court set aside the Magistrate order on February 9. The Sessions Court relied on five independent and separate enquiry reports prepared by medical professionals, which absolved the surgeon of any medical negligence.\n\"In all the said enquiries, the medical experts have categorically concluded that no negligence can be attributed on the part of the petitioner in the treatment of the child. They have concluded that there is nothing on record that prima facie substantiate the allegations of the complainant,\" the judge noted.\nAn inquiry conducted by Union Ministry of Health and Welfare had also found that the doctor had exercised a reasonable degree of commitment in treating the difficult case of the child, the Court observed.\nThe Court further noted that these committees had comprehensively analyzed and inquired into the alleged negligence by the doctors of Lok Nayak hospital, including the petitioner.\n\"All the said inquiry reports have absolved the petitioner of negligence in treatment and operation of the child. In absence of attribution of even civil negligence to the petitioner into the allegations of the complainant, question of attributing culpable negligence to him does not arise,\" the judge underscored. \nThe petitioner accepted that after the removal of the organ, the child's kidney had not been properly preserved. However, he told the Court that action had been taken against the nurses responsible for the same. Further, he had contended that no criminal offence could be made out against him for such a lapse, even if it were true. \nThe Court agreed with the petitioner-doctor on this count as well, observing, \n\"The ill preservation of removed kidney of the son of the complainant and misplacement of part of his treatment record does not fall within the ambit of any culpable act. The same can at the most be a case of civil negligence, for which FIR cannot be directed to be lodged. Thus, the Trial Court has wrongly placed reliance on the said facts to invoke his powers under section 156(3) of CrPC.\"\nIn this backdrop, the Sessions Court concluded that there was no justifiable reason to assume that the petitioner had committed any offence and quashed the Magistrate's order. \nAdvocates Shiksha Ashra and Namit Saxena appeared for the petitioner.

Union of India & Anr].\nA Division Bench of Justices C Hari Shankar and Manoj Jain said there is nothing in the PoSH Act that limits its scope only to cases where a woman employee is sexually harassed by another employee working in her own office, and bars its application where the delinquent employee is employed elsewhere.\nThe Court further said that if the provisions of the PoSH Act are limited only to the people working in the same departments, it would strike at the very root of the statute, its ethos and philosophy.\nIt observed that in an era where women are equalling men in every professional achievement, there can be no compromise on objectives of the PoSH Act.\n“Equalizing of the sexes in every aspect of life is, therefore, a constitutional imperative. The working environment is required to be as safe and secure for women, as it is for men. Even an apprehension, by a woman, that her safety might be compromised or endangered in the workplace is, therefore, abhorrent to our constitutional ethos,” the order stated.\nAny interpretation of the provisions of the Act which downplays or impedes complete achievement and implementation of its objectives, has to be firmly eschewed, the Bench said.\nThe Court made these observations while dealing with a plea filed by an Indian Revenue Service (IRS) officer challenging a meeting notice issued by the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC).\nThe petitioner, Dr Sohail Malik, was issued notice after an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer filed a complaint alleging that he had sexually harassed her.\nThe notice was first challenged before the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). However, the CAT dismissed Malik’s plea.\nIt was Malik’s case that he and the complainant work in separate departments and that the ICC of one department cannot conduct an inquiry under the PoSH Act against an officer belonging to another department.\nMalik’s counsel contended that under Section 13 of the PoSH Act, the ICC has to forward its decision to the employer, who has to take action. The employer being the head of the office where the complainant is working, even if the decision of the ICC is forwarded to the said employer, as he has no disciplinary control over the petitioner, Section 13 would become inoperative, it was argued.\nAfter considering the case, the Bench rejected Malik’s argument and held that nothing in Section 11 (1) of the PoSH Act restricts its application only to cases where the victim and the perpetrator are employees of the same department.\n“Section 11(1) merely states that, ‘where the respondent is an employee’, the ICC shall proceed to make inquiry into the complaint ‘in accordance with the service rules applicable to the respondent’. In our considered opinion, the use of the words “in accordance with the service rules applicable to the respondent’ itself indicates that the statute has kept in mind a possibility where the respondent may be governed by service rules which are not those which apply to the complainant or to the department where the complainant is working.”\nThe Court added that in order to make provisions of the PoSH Act “meaningful and applicable even in a case where the alleged perpetrator of sexual harassment is an employee of another department, the definition of ‘employer’ under Section 2(g)(i) of the SHW Act has to be read as including the employer of the department where the alleged perpetrator of sexual harassment is working.\n“Under Section 13(1), therefore, if the employer who has to take action on the basis of the findings of the ICC is the head of a department other than that in which the complainant-employee is working, we see no embargo under the SHW Act on the findings of the ICC being forwarded to that employer, who has disciplinary control over the alleged perpetrator of sexual harassment, to take action on the basis thereof.”\nFinally, the Court refused to quash the ICC notice and upheld the CAT's decision.\nSenior Advocate Arun Bhardwaj along with Advocates RK Saini, Nishant Bahuguna and Usha Sharma appeared for the petitioner.\nCentral Government Standing Counsel (CGSC) Vineet Dhanda along with Advocates Vinay Yadav and Gurleen Kaur appeared for the Union of India."}

State of Gujarat and Others].\nA division bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and MM Sundresh, therefore, disapproved the decision of a departmental selection committee in Gujarat to reduce the qualifying marks for the post of Supervisor Instructor Class III after the publication of results.\nThe Court was informed that this was done to facilitate the appointment of candidates belonging to a special category comprising women, persons with disabilities and former members of the armed forces.\n\"Fixing cut-off marks for a particular category has got a rationale behind it. Reducing it only for the purpose of providing employment to a particular category, when the others have already acquired some right would be an affront to Article 14 of the Constitution of India,\" the Court said. \nThe Court found that the decision to reduce the cut-off, in this case, was not based on any objective criteria or the suitability of the candidate, but for extraneous reasons, \"to accommodate otherwise ineligible candidates.\" \nThe bench opined that once cut-off marks are fixed on a conscious consideration of the marks needed to be eligible for a post, it could not be reduced without \"a sound reason that the reduced marks also would be sufficient to be suitable for that post.\"\nThe Court was dealing with a challenge to the decision of the Gujarat government to relax the cut-off marks for candidates belonging to a special category comprising of women, persons with disabilities, and ex-servicemen when it came to recruitments for the post of Supervisor Instructor. Pertinently, this was done after the results were published.\nThe State government decided to treat it as a form of special reservation because the percentage of candidates expected to fill the post from such a category (which is ordinarily classified as a horizontal reservation category) was found inadequate.\nNotably, prior to this decision, the State had informed if all the reserved seats are not filled by reserved-category candidates, then such seats could be allotted to other eligible candidates (including general category candidates).\nThe government's decision to relax the cut-off for the special category, therefore, affected the chances of getting these spots for others falling outside the special category.\nHence, aspirants affected by the decision challenged the move before the High Court. An adverse ruling by a division bench of the Gujarat High Court prompted them to move the Supreme Court in appeal.\nThe Supreme Court found that the selection committee went against the set rules when it had reduced the cut-off marks to facilitate the appointment of candidates belonging to the horizontal reservation by treating it as a vertical reservation.\nThe Court further observed that the advertisement originally issued was binding and that changes could only have been introduced by way of an amendment \"and nothing else.\"\nThe Court noted that even if such an amendment was made, it had to be in line with Article 14. An amendment could not have been introduced to give an entry for a special reservation, when rights had already accrued to a candidate not belonging to such a special reservation category, the Court added.\nThe Court further held that neither the State nor the selection committee has the unbridled power to modify the selection process and reduce cut-off marks after the results are published. \nHence, the Court found the High Court ruling in favour of the challenged decision to be unsustainable. \nAll the same, the Court acknowledged that the decision under challenge had a laudable object. Therefore, it decided to moderate the impact of its decision with respect to those candidates from the special category who had obtained a favourable ruling from the division bench of the High Court. \nThese private respondents were directed to be considered in the horizontal reserved category spots, provided that the permissible reservation limit was not exceeded and without upsetting the appointment of the appellants and others similarly placed. \nSenior Advocate PS Patwalia appeared for the appellants.

Worshipping of the deity, by entering into the temple, is to be given to one and all. Any kind of bigotry or discrimination is unacceptable. Trial in such cases cannot be interdicted,\" the Court said. \nThe Court, therefore, refused to halt criminal proceedings against the eight persons accused of preventing the SC family from entering the Gadi Chowdeshwari Temple on the ground that their entry would make the temple \"unholy\". \nThe accused were also alleged to have verbally abused and attacked the family, which included a woman, her husband and their child. \n\"It is rather unfortunate that despite constitutional abolition of any form of untouchability, it still remains and persists in rural areas of the nation. Although temples are seen to be symbols of unity and inclusivity, denial of rights of temple entry and worship, to persons belonging to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, still looms large,\" the Court observed after examining the allegations.\nThe Court said that the attitude of the accused appeared to be regressive since they had allegedly denied entry to a temple solely because the family belonged to a scheduled caste. \n\"This discrimination should stop and stop forthwith. The fact that it is still prevailing shocks the conscience of the Court. Human beings are to be treated as human beings,\" the Court observed.\nNotably, the Court also laid down that a \"temple\" is a public place for the purpose of invoking the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (SC/ST Act). \nAbuse of a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste near a temple would, therefore, attract Section 3 of the SC/ST Act, the Court held. \n\"The abuses are hurled and hurled in public which is viewed by several public as it was outside the doors of the Temple and the Temple is, trite, a public place. Therefore, the challenge to the offences under the Atrocities Act so laid tumbles down,\" the Court said. \nThe Court was dealing with a case where the complainant had alleged that in 2016, she and her family were attacked and verbally abused through derogatory references to their caste when they sought to visit the Gadi Chowdeshwari temple.\nA criminal complaint was lodged against eight persons. The complaint cited charges under Sections 3(1)(10) and (11) of the SC/ST Act, along with various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\nThe accused, however, asserted that no offence was made out. Notably, they argued that even if any abuse took place, it happened within the temple, which is not a \"public place\" or a \"place of public view.\" Therefore, the SC/ST Act would not be attracted, they argued. \nThe Court, however, disagreed. \n\"Being fully aware of the caste of the complainant and her family, they were stopped from entering the temple only because they belonged to the said caste and abuses were hurled outside the temple. If this cannot construed to be a place of public view or even a public place, I fail to understand what else could be,\" the Court said. \nThe Court further opined that if the complaint and the charge sheet were read together, it would depict horrendous acts by the accused.\nThe Court, therefore, dismissed the plea of the accused paving the way for the trial against them to continue. \nAdvocates Satish MS and Malipatil PS appeared for the petitioners (accused). \nGovernment pleader Yashodha KP appeared for State government."}

The order of the NCLT was passed in applications moved by the Resolution Professional of the Corporate Debtor and Exim Bank under Section 60(5) of the IBC.\nThe appellant has assailed the order of NCLAT on two broad grounds: first, that the NCLT and NCLAT do not possess jurisdiction under the IBC to adjudicate on a contractual dispute between the appellant and the Corporate Debtor; and second, in any event, the termination of the PPA was validly made under Article 9.2.1(e) and Article 9.3.1 of the PPA.\nThe Court held that the NCLT had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute and also ruled against the appellant on merits, thereby dismissing the appeal. \nThe court noted that in the present case, the PPA was terminated solely on the ground of insolvency, since the event of default contemplated under Article 9.2.1(e) was the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the Corporate Debtor. \nThe court held that in the absence of the insolvency of the Corporate Debtor, there would be no ground to terminate the PPA. \n\"The termination is not on a ground independent of the insolvency. The present dispute solely arises out of and relates to the insolvency of the Corporate Debtor\", the court observed.\nSupreme Court also held that the Resolution professional can approach the NCLT for adjudication of disputes that are related to the insolvency resolution process, however, for adjudication of disputes that arise dehors the insolvency of the Corporate Debtor, the RP must approach the relevant competent authority. \n\"For instance, if the dispute in the present matter related to the non-supply of electricity, the RP would not have been entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the NCLT under the IBC.

This means that place of occurrence or place of imprisonment of convicts are not relevant for remission. The definition of appropriate government is otherwise. The intention of the government is that the State under whom the convict was tried and sentenced was the appropriate government. This places emphasis on the place of trial and rather than where the crime took place,\" the Court said.\nIt is not the government of the State within whose territory the offence has occurred which can pass the remission and thus, the order of remission has to be quashed, the bench held. \nThe Court in its judgment also strongly came down upon one of the convicts, Radhyesham, for playing fraud upon the Court by suppressing material facts and getting a favourable order from the top court in May 2022 which eventually led to the release of all the eleven convicts. \nThe Court said that the May 2022 judgment was obtained by fraud and therefore, not good in law.\nThe Court also came down upon the Gujarat government for not filing a review plea against the May 2022 judgment and instead being complicit and acting in tandem with the convicts and usurping the Maharashtra government's jurisdiction to grant remission to convicts. \n\"It was the State of Maharashtra who could have only passed the remission orders respondent no 3 surreptitiously filed the plea before the Supreme Court. Taking advantage of May 13, 2022 order of this Court, other convicts also filed remission applications and the Gujarat government passed remission orders...Gujarat was complicit and acted in tandem with respondent no. 3 in this case. This Court was misled by suppressing facts. Use of power by Gujarat was only an usurpation of power by the State,\" the apex court ruled.\nOn the conundrum of sending the convicts back to the jail, the Court held that rule of law has to prevail over the liberty of the convicts. \n\"Rule of law does not mean protection to a fortunate few. In ADM Jabalpur, Justice Khanna had said rule of law is the antithesis to arbitrariness. We hold justice cannot be done without adherence to the rule of law,\" the Court opined. \nIf that is not the case then such orders of the court would be reduced to chimera. Courts have to dispense justice and not allow justice to be dispensed with, the bench underlined.\n\"We hold that deprivation of liberty to the respondents is justified. They have lost their right to liberty once they were convicted and imprisoned. if they want to seek remission in accordance with law then they have to be in jail. Rule law must prevail. Thus, all respondents are directed to report to jail authorities within two weeks,\" the bench ordered.\nThe judgment came in a batch of petitions challenging the remission granted to the convicts in the case. \nThe case concerns the early release of 11 convicts who had gang raped Bano and murdered her family members during the riots.\nThe convicts who were set free by the State are Jaswant Nai, Govind Nai, Shailesh Bhatt, Radhyesham Shah, Bipin Chandra Joshi, Kesarbhai Vohania, Pradeep Mordhiya, Bakabhai Vohania, Rajubhai Soni, Mitesh Bhatt and Ramesh Chandana.\nThe Gujarat government had granted a remission of their sentence following a May 2022 judgment in which the top court held that an application of remission should be considered in line with the policy of the State where the crime was committed and not where the trial was held.\nPursuant to that judgment, the Gujarat government had applied its remission policy to release the convicts though the trial in the case had taken place in Maharashtra.\nBut the top court in its verdict today noted that the May 2022 judgment came in an Article 32 petition filed by one of the convicts (respondent no. 3) after his petition was dismissed by the Gujarat High Court which said that the Maharashtra government will have to consider the plea for remission.\nHe then filed a remission application in Maharashtra and presiding judge of trial and DGP Maharashtra had given their opinion on it.\nMeanwhile, he moved the Supreme Court suppressing these facts and the Supreme Court passed a judgment in his favour opining that the Gujarat government was the appropriate government\n\"If respondent 3 was aggrieved by Gujarat High Court order of 2019 he could file an appeal here. But he did not do so. He moved Maharashtra for remission. When the opinion on remission there was negative, he moved the Supreme Court. Thus, he played fraud on this court. High Court order could not be set aside in an Article 32 plea,\" the Court underscored.\nSince the May 2022 judgment was obtained by playing fraud upon the Court, it was held to be non est in law.\nGujarat Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Raj Kumar had reportedly said that the convicts were released due to the “completion of 14 years” in jail and other factors such as “age, nature of the crime, behaviour in prison and so on”.\nThe Gujarat government's decision was challenged by various petitioners including Bano before the top court.\nFollow our coverage of the case here."}

The list given of the relations is exhaustive and there is no scope for any other interpretation,\" the bench held. \nAs per the facts of the case, the petitioner Shobha's husband was working as a conductor with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) when he passed away.\nThe petitioner later secured a job in the State's health department. \nHer old parents-in-law sought maintenance from her on the ground that they are aged and unable to look after themselves. \nTheir application for maintenance was allowed by the Nyayadhikari Gram Nyayalaya, Jalkot in Latur district. \nThe petitioner, however, opposed the same on the ground that the parents-in-law have four married daughters, all of whom are well settled. She pointed out that her in-laws have at least 2.30 acres of land and that after her husband's death, the mother-in-law had received an amount of ₹1.88 lakh. Apart from this amount, some money was paid to the petitioner's minor son. \nFurther, the petitioner contended that all the four daughters have a share in the property of her in-laws' and therefore their daughters are liable to pay the maintenance to their parents. \nRelying on a case where the High Court had ordered the widowed daughter-in-law to maintain her old parents-in-law, the counsel representing Shobha's in-laws argued that they were solely dependent on their son. Everything (properties) in the name of their son would be transferred to the petitioner's name and therefore when she is to succeed the property, it becomes her liability to maintain the old in-laws, it was contended.\nHowever, the petitioner contested the stand and point out that the case in which the court had ordered the daughter-in-law to maintain her in-laws was on a different footing. She pointed out that in that case, the daughter-in-law therein, had secured a job on compassionate basis and she had undertook to look after the family. \nIn the present case, the petitioner argued that she did not secure job on compassionate grounds and that she has not replaced her husband and therefore, she is not legally bound to pay the maintenance under Section 125 of CrPC.\nAccepting the contentions, the bench quashed the orders of the Nyayadhikari Gram Nyayalaya.\nAdvocate JM Murkute appeared for the Petitioner. \nAdvocate Subhash S Chillarge represented the In-laws."}

The judge had also ordered the commissioner to visit the site and inspect and collect evidence as to whether the deities as contended by Rakhi, exist at the site. The commissioner was further given liberty to seek police force assistance in case of any disturbance or resistance to collection evidence by virtue of videography.\nThe petitioner-Masajid board moved High Court contending that the civil judge ought not have appointed a court commissioner. It was also contended that the court shouldn't have granted liberty to seek police assistance even before the commissioner could visit the site.\nJustice Munir, however, dismissed the petition summarily, saying the contentions of the petitioner board are ill-founded.\n\"Apparently, the suit claims the existence of the named Deities on the property in dispute and that is a kind of evidence that would fall under the exception to the normal rule for issue of a commission, spoken of in K. Raghunath Rao's case. The existence or non-existence of the deities on the property in dispute is a matter about which the parties under the circumstances can hardly produce evidence. Even otherwise, it is evidence which is to be found on the spot where the disputed property exists and can be best gathered therefrom. If the Court has exercised its discretion to issue a commission, so that evidence about the fact in issue can be collected, it cannot be said that the order is beyond jurisdiction of the Court under Order XXVI Rule 9 of the Code of Civil Procedure,\" the High Court said. \nIt further said that in certain instance it becomes necessary to secure evidence on the spot which parties cannot produce and a court commissioner can be tasked with the same. \n\"It is not always that a commission is issued to elucidate evidence already on record. There can be cases where it is necessary to secure evidence, which is available on the spot and the parties cannot produce it. The commission issued here clearly falls into that category. Quite apart, the commission does not, in any way, impinge upon the rights of the petitioner. If anything is said in the report of the Advocate Commissioner that the petitioner or any other defendant to the suit feels is contrary to the spot position, he can always object to the Commissioner's report, which would then be a subject matter for decision by the Court on the basis of evidence on record,\" the judge opined.\nSenior Advocate Sayed Ahmed Faizan appeared for the petitioners.\nAdvocate Hari Shankar Jain appeared for the respondents."}

It is highly improbable that the respondent being a government servant, would have approached a poor person like the defacto complainant, seeking financial assistance,\" the order stated. \nHence, it held Mohanakrishnan guilty of cheating under IPC and for offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\"Therefore, under the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court finds that the transaction between the respondent and the defacto-complianant is not loan transaction or money transaction.

It was also alleged that there was a dispute between the victim's family and the accused regarding some land, owing to which he was falsely implicated in the case. \nThe Court, however, found that nothing had been presented to support the claim made by the accused regarding the alleged land dispute. \nThe State further informed that the victim's age has been found to be thirteen-years following medical examination. The Additional Government Advocate stood by the prosecution's version that the accused had forcibly raped the victim before he was apprehended by her family.

When she raised her voice, the accused got up, pushed her away, and fled the scene.\nThe counsel appearing for the accused contended that as per the medical report, there was no evidence of recent sexual intercourse as semen was not detected at the time of examination of the minor girl.\nHe further contended that the trial court had not appreciated the medical evidence on record properly and had arrived at an erroneous conclusion that there was penetrative sexual assault.\nThe accused further claimed that the survivor's family filed the sexual assault case against him due to the grudge they hold against him for refusing to sell his property as allegedly demanded by the survivor's mother.\nHe argued that except the evidence of the girl and her mother, there was no corroborative evidence to their testimony and in its absence, it is not safe to rely on their testimonies.\nThe Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the State contended that no mother would venture to involve the modesty of her minor girl for the purpose of wreaking vengeance against the accused simply for not conceding to the demand to sell some property of the accused.\nHe further contended that the survivor might have been subjected to sexual intercourse as the medical report stated that the vagina admitted one finger and the hymen of the victim girl was torn with presence of blood.\nHe argued that the judgment of the trial court was perfectly sustainable under law and it does not suffer from any legal infirmity.\nThe High Court after careful consideration of the facts, medical reports and statements of the witnesses said that there were no valid grounds emanating from the record to disbelieve the testimony of the victim girl’s mother.\nAccordingly, the Court dismissed the criminal appeal filed by the accused and upheld the trial court’s order."}

No evidence is led as to the verbal altercation, which PW-1 (Monu) admits to. No evidence is led as to the detention of PW-1 and the accused persons in the police station for several days, to which PW-1 deposes. This creates doubt in our minds as to the credibility of PW-1 as an eyewitness,” the Court said.\nThe court noted that the actual time of death of the victim was also shrouded in mystery as there were some errors in but even then the time of death is stated to be between 2:15 am and 3:15 am. \nIt added that this timing also contradicts Monu’s testimony that he saw the accused men assault the victim from around 8:00 pm for about two-and-half hours the previous night.\n\"This discrepancy casts more than a shadow of doubt as to the very presence of PW-1 at the crime scene at the relevant time. When we say this, we also remind ourselves of PW-1’s statements that PW-1 was a 'secret informer'; and PW-1's own statement that there had been a verbal altercation between him and the accused persons on March 29, 2014,” the Court said. \nIt was also found that though there were allegations that the accused hit the victim on head with beer bottles and pieces of brick and stone however no bottle or shards of glass were recovered from the crime scene, nor were there any traces of alcohol in the victim's body.\n“Absent any evidence in this behalf, the allegations regarding purchase of liquor, administering liquor to the victim and hitting her on the head with a beer bottle, also appear to be embellishments. We find ourselves unable to ignore these embellishments, if only because they are elements of fabrication of evidence on the part of PW-1.”\nThe judges further held,\n“On the touchstone of the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that ‘contradictions’ in testimony are not acceptable, though ‘discrepancies’ may be, in view of what is observed above, we are not persuaded to accept PW-1’s testimony as being truthful.”\nThe court further said that though the incident happened on March 28/29, 2014, four of the accused were arrested on April 4, 2014 while the fifth person was arrested on May 6, 2014.\nProsecution had claimed that on the day of the arrest, four of the accused were wearing blood-stained clothes.\nThe judges noted that this circumstance that “strains credulity” and in any case, the forensic analysis of the blood found on the clothes only showed that it was of human origin.\nThe test was inconclusive regarding rhesus factor and no DNA test was conducted to establish any connection with the blood group of the deceased, court said.\nAll the appeals were, therefore, allowed and the judgment of conviction and sentencing order by the trial court was set aside. \nThe Court directed that the appellants be released from custody. \nSenior Advocate Maninder Singh along with advocates Sumer Kumar Sethi, Aekta Vats, Anshika Batra, Aishwarya Rao, Mansi Rao, Harsh Prabhakar, Anirudh Tanwar, Harjeet Singh Sachdeva, Dhruv Chaudhry, Shikha Garg, Jay Kumar Bharadwaj, Sumeet Verma and Mahinder Pratap Singh appeared for appellants.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Ashish Dutta appeared for State."}

{"id": "id_1260", "reference_summary": "The Kerala High Court on Monday permitted a woman claiming to be separated from her allegedly abusive husband to terminate her 21-week-old pregnancy [Aryamol v Union of India & Ors.]. \nSinge-judge Justice VG Arun also underscored that a husband's consent is not necessary under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (MTP Act) for termination of pregnancy. \nThe Rules framed under the MTP Act state that one of the factors for allowing termination between 20 and 24 weeks gestation is \"change of marital status during the ongoing pregnancy (widowhood and divorce)\".\nEven though the pregnant woman in the instant wasn't legally divorced or widowed, the Court noted the woman's changed equation with her husband, showcased by the fact that she had filed a criminal complaint against him and the fact that the husband did not show any inclination of wanting to continue with her, amounts to a \"drastic change in her matrimonial life\".\nTaking a leaf out of the Supreme Court's recent judgment in x v. Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department & Anr., in which the top court adopted a purposive interpretation of the MTP Act, the Court held that the drastic change in matrimonial life of the pregnant woman is equivalent to a 'change of marital status.\n\"As held in Suchita Srivastava v Chandigarh Admn, a woman's right to make reproductive choice is also a dimension of her personal liberty, as understood under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. There can be no restriction on a woman’s right to exercise her reproductive choice to either procreate or to abstain from procreating....\n.....If interpreted and understood in the above manner, the drastic change in the matrimonial life of a pregnant woman is equivalent to the 'change of her marital status.’ The word 'divorce' cannot in any manner qualify or restrict that right,\" the order stated.\nPertinently, the Court also observed that the Act does not require a woman to obtain her husband's consent to terminate a pregnancy.\n\"Another crucial factor to be noted is that the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act does not contain any provision requiring the woman to obtain her husband's permission for terminating the pregnancy. The reason being that it is the woman who bears the stress and strain of the pregnancy and the delivery,\" the Court said in its order.\nThe Court passed the order on a plea moved by a 21-year-old pregnant woman seeking medical termination of her 21+ weeks pregnancy. \nThe petitioner had met and married her husband, against the wishes of her family, when she was pursuing her undergraduate studies and he was a bus conductor in the area.\nAfter marriage, however, the petitioner alleged that the husband and his mother treated her poorly with demands of dowry. \nShe also alleged that her husband questioned paternity of the unborn baby and refused to provide support, either financial or emotional.\nWhen she sought to terminate her pregnancy, the doctors at Family Planning Clinic that she went to, refused the same as there were no legal documents to prove her separation/divorce from her husband.\nSubsequently, she filed a police complaint against her husband and a crime was registered for the offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of Indian Penal Code.\nWhen she went back to the clinic, the doctors once again refused to relent to her request, forcing her to approach the Court. \nAdvocate Liji J Vadakedom, appearing for the petitioner, contended that, rather than a restrictive interpretation, the provisions of the MTP Act and Rules, call for liberal interpretation, recognising the woman’s reproductive choice to either procreate or to abstain from procreating.\nHowever, Government Pleader submitted that the petitioner being a married woman, there has to be a joint decision by the spouses regarding termination of pregnancy. This being the purpose behind Rule 3B(c), there cannot be any interpretation to the contrary, it was contended. \nThe Court noted that the the Medical Board constituted at its direction had opined that MTP may be done since continuance of the pregnancy will have a negative impact on the mental health of the petitioner. \nAnother determining factor noted by the Court was the petitioner's environment. \n\"From the averments and the arguments, it has come out that the petitioner belongs to the weaker section of society and does not have the financial capacity to bring up the child on her own. The records also reveal that the petitioner’s husband had refused to accompany her to the hospital from the initial stages of her pregnancy. As such, the petitioner is denied emotional support also,\" the Court observed.\nThe question before the Court was whether the prayer for permission to terminate the pregnancy can be allowed, even if the petitioner does not fall within the category of women eligible for termination of pregnancy as per the rules. \n\"A perusal of the rule shows that, women, whose marital status changed during the ongoing pregnancy (widowhood or divorce), are also included. Indisputably, the petitioner's matrimonial life has completely changed during the pregnancy,\" the Court observed.\nTherefore, it permitted the petitioner to have her pregnancy terminated and issued necessary directions for the same."}

The case also highlights the issues of medical negligence as well as medical malpractice which continues for want of any check of such Salons by the competent authorities,” the Court stated. \nCriminal liability in such circumstances is writ large and is much more than gross negligence or recklessness.

The court opined that parents-in-law are expected to protect the daughter-in-law and reprimand their son if the son raises demand for dowry. If not, it finally brings a bad name for the family and disturbs its peace for all times to come, the judge observed.\n\"Through the medium of this order I convey my concern to the govt to establish marriage counselling Centres in every District, where especially before the celebration of marriage, the couples along with their family members be called to have parleys with the experts of the field who can guide them how to behave to each other in the new relationship, based on social, moral, ethical and religious sanctions (sic),\" the order said. \nThe judge added that he felt it necessary to convey this concern given that if misunderstandings between a woman and her in-laws are not settled and shaped properly, it may culminate in horrible criminal cases like the one at hand.\nThe court, therefore, rejected the anticipatory bail plea while also pointing out that anticipatory bail is only meant for cases where it appears that a bona fide person has been unnecessarily roped in on account of vengeance or similar reasons. It is not meant for those explicitly involved in serious offences like dowry deaths, the court added."}

Therefore, at this stage, the learned counsel for the appellant cannot press into service the aspect of consent,\" the Court held.\nThe accused-appellant, Peer Mohammad, had been arrested for offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (the POCSO Act), and the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act for raping a minor girl.\nAfter his regular bail application was rejected by the Additional Sessions Judge, the appellant approached the High Court. \nHis counsel, advocate Mir Nagman Ali, contended that further imprisonment of the appellant was unnecessary as the investigating officer had completed the investigation and filed chargesheet.\nHe submitted that the appellant and survivor had a love affair and that she had willingly eloped with him and spent about 45 days at his residence in Kaushambi, Uttar Pradesh.\nThe Court examined the chargesheet and deduced that that survivor did not have any affection towards the appellant and it was the appellant who tried to persuade her to go wit him against her wish. \n“Her statement would show that the appellant had extended threat to her to kill her younger brother aged about 3½ years, which was precisely the reason for the victim to accompany the appellant,” the order noted.\nThe Court also clarified that the age of the survivor would be a matter of a trial.\nThus, taking into account the survivor's statement, medical opinion, and statements by other prosecution witnesses, the Court decided not to exercise its power to release the accused on bail.\nThe fact that the appellant had no roots in Maharashtra was also taken into account by the Court to dismiss the plea."}

Assistant Director Directorate of Enforcement].\nA bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Bela M Trivedi added that it has become a great challenge for investigating agencies to detect and comprehend the intricate nature of transactions and the role of the persons involved in them.\n\"Lot of minute exercise is expected to be undertaken by the Investigating Agency to see that no innocent person is wrongly booked and that no culprit escapes from the clutches of the law,\" said the top court.\nThe Court, while referring to various judgments passed by it in the past, noted that the economic offences have been held to constitute a class apart and need to be visited with a different approach in the matter of bail.\nThe economic offences having deep-rooted conspiracies and involving huge loss of public funds need to be viewed seriously, the Court opined.\nIt added they need to be considered as grave offences affecting the economy of the country as a whole and thereby posing serious threat to the financial health of the country.\n\"Undoubtedly, economic offences have serious repercussions on the development of the country as a whole,\" the Court remarked.\nThe Court made the observations while dismissing the bail plea moved by Shakti Bhog Foods’ former Vice President (Purchases) Tarun Kumar in a money laundering case against the company. \nWhile doing so, the Court also underscored that when the detention of accused is continued, the courts are expected to conclude the trial within a reasonable time to ensure upholding of the right to speedy trial.\nHis counsel had submitted that a similarly placed co-accused Raman Bhuraria was granted bail by the Delhi High Court. However, the top court said the bail order has already been challenged.\nIt also held that a person accused of a crime cannot seek bail on the ground of parity with a co-accused in the case, if such co-accused was incorrectly granted bail without legal justification.\nA court is required to look into the accused's role when principle of parity is invoked by the accused for seeking bail, the top court clarified.\nWhile observing that parity is not the law, the Court said the jurisdiction of the higher or superior court cannot be invoked for repeating or multiplying the same irregularity or illegality or for passing a similar wrong order.\nObserving that the principle of parity is based on Article 14 of the Constitution, the Court said,\n“Article 14 is not meant to perpetuate the illegality or irregularity. If there has been a benefit or advantage conferred on one or a set of people by any authority or by the court, without legal basis or justification, other persons could not claim as a matter of right the benefit on the basis of such wrong decision.”\nSince the order granting bail to Bhuraria is under consideration before a coordinate bench of the top court, the bench said it would not be appropriate for it to make any observation with regard to it.\nOn the argument against petitioner’s indefinite incarceration despite completion of probe against him, the Court said he has not been able to overcome the stringent conditions for bail under Section 45 of PMLA.\nThe Court added that the burden of proof lies on the accused to show that he was not prima facie guilty of such offence, for the purpose of the condition under Section 45.\n“Of course, such discharge of burden could be on the probabilities, nonetheless in the instant case there being sufficient material on record adduced by the respondent showing the thick involvement of the appellant in the alleged offence of money laundering under Section 3 of the said Act, the Court is not inclined to grant bail to the appellant,” the Court concluded.\nSenior Advocate Siddharth Luthra with Advocates Malak Manish Bhatt, Neeha Nagpal, Samridhi, Kartikeye Dang, Rudraditya Khare and Sahir Seth represented the petitioner. \nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju with Advocates Mukesh Kumar Maroria, Annam Venkatesh, Arkaj Kumar and Zoheb Hussain represented the Enforcement Directorate"}

Simply because, there is low CIBIL score to a student, who is an applicant for Education loan, I am of the considered opinion that, Education loan application ought not have been rejected by Bank,\" the Court said.\nThe petitioner in this case was a student who sought an education loan from the State Bank of India. The bank, however, rejected his application as his CIBIL score was only 560. \nSenior advocate KK Chandran Pillai appeared for the bank and explained that the CIBIL score was so low because the petitioner had availed two loans, one of which was overdue for ₹16,667 and the other was written off by the bank. Therefore, he argued that the Court should not grant any interim order in favour of the petitioner. \nPillai also contended that the Credit Information Companies Act, 2005, the Credit Information Companies Rules, 2006 and the circulars issued by the State Bank of India prohibits disbursement of loan in such situation.\nSenior Advocate George Poonthottam, appearing for the student-petitioner, submitted that unless the loan amount is disbursed immediately, the petitioner will be in trouble. \nHe also informed the Court that the petitioner already has a job offer from a multi-national company and, therefore, will be able to clear the entire loan amount. \nThe Court opined that even though Pillai had raised some legal contentions, the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner, especially since he already has a job offer and would complete his course on May 31, 2023.\n\"Here is a case, where the petitioner obtained a job offer too.

During this time, the law graduate would be able to do all tasks allied to the legal profession other than the function of acting or pleading before courts, it said. \nIt also called for an appropriate rule to be framed laying down that an enrolled advocate who takes up employment in a non-legal context for a substantial period would be deemed to be a new enrolee, and would be required to take AIBE again.\n\"We believe that the requirements of an active legal practice and that of an unconnected job are different.

Only 17 oxygen concentrators are available with 250 oxygen cylinders against 300 beds,\" the order said. \nThe Court further said that the situation is similar as regard testing mechanism for COVID-19.\n\"If we have to test 30 percent of the population i.e. almost 10 lacs in the rural areas of district Bijnor within three month’s time, then we will have to conduct 10000 tests per day, but from the statement made by the District Magistrate we do not see any such robust testing in near future in district Bijnor,\" the order stated. \nFurther, the court also expressed its displeasure over Covid-19 testing in rural areas, in comparison to urban areas and directed the Uttar Pradesh government to immediately ramp up testing in rural areas and in small cities and towns. \n\"In the population of thirty-two Lakhs, if the testing is done of only 1200 persons and that too in 60:40 ratio then the situation is not happy.\"\nThe court also took note of the reply sought by the government regarding the vaccination process in Uttar Pradesh. It was informed by the state counsel that a global tender has been invited by the Uttar Pradesh Government for the same. \nIn addition to this, the court suggested following aspects which for the government's considetation:\n1. The vaccines may be first vigorously tested and only thereafter may be given out for use by the public. For this various incentives may be announced. \n2. Big medical companies which are working in the country may not have their own vaccines but they may take the formula from just any of the vaccine manufacturers in the world and start producing the vaccine. In this way, they would help the country to meet the shortage of vaccines which it is facing today. \n\"For that matter, one cannot understand as to why the Government of ours which is a welfare state is not trying to manufacture the vaccine itself on a large scale,\" the court added \n3. Such people who might like to buy the vaccines for the have nots, may be allowed to do so and may also be given certain benefits under the Income Tax Act.\n4. Big business houses who take various advantages under the taxation laws by donating to various religious organizations may be asked to divert their funds to vaccines.\nWith regard to improvement of medical infrastructure, the Court said that the viability of the following may be looked into: \n(i) Oxygen facility in nursing homes: All nursing homes should have an oxygen facility on every bed and every nursing home/ hospital which has more than 20 beds should have at least 40 per cent beds as Intensive Care Units. \n(iii) Install ventilators and High Flow Nasal Cannula in Nursing Homes: The designated 40 per cent; 25 per cent should have ventilators, 25 per cent should have High Flow Nasal Cannula and 50 per cent of the 40 per cent reserved beds should have bipap machines. This should be made compulsorily for all the nursing homes/ hospitals in the State of Uttar Pradesh. \n(iv) Oxygen plant to be installed: Every nursing home/ hospital which has more than 30 beds should compulsorily have an oxygen production plant. \n(v) Enhance medical facilities in other Medical Colleges across the State: The Court said that apart from various institutes like Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute and the Universities like the King George’s Medical University and Banaras Hindu University, there are five more medical colleges in Prayagraj, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur and Gorakhpur. \n\"These Colleges should have enhanced facilities as are there with the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute within a period of four months. Emergency laws should be applied for the acquisition of land for them. Funds should be provided to them forthwith so that they graduate from a medical college to an Institute of the standard of the Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute. For this there should also be given a certain extent of autonomy.\"\n(vi) Improve medical facilities in rural areas and villages: They should be given all kinds of pathology facilities and treatments should be made available in Community Health Centres which are at par to the treatment given by Level-2 hospitals in bigger cities. If a patient however becomes serious in the rural areas or in small towns then ambulances with all kinds of Intensive Care Unit facilities should be provided so that the patient can be brought to a hospital which has proper medical facilities in a bigger town.\nBesides the above, the Court directed the appointment of Nodal Officers by the District Judges of districts Bijnor, Bahraich, Barabanki, Shrawasti, Jaunpur, Mainpuri, Mau, Aligarh, Etah, Etawah, Firozabad and Deoria.\n\"These Nodal Officers shall submit their reports within a week’s time in the light of directions contained in our order dated 27.04.2021.

If this Court refuses to exercise its jurisdiction on technicalities in cases of violations of fundamental rights, it will lead to a ripple effect that will result in a dysfunctional social contract, wherein the people of this country would become subject to an arbitrary and unfettered tyranny of the state.\"\nThe bench pointed out out that the practice of filing preliminary chargesheets to increase remand was first flagged by the Law Commission of India in its 14th Report, after which an amendment to the CrPC was made providing for default bail.\nA supplementary chargesheet where it is explicitly stated that the investigation is still pending cannot be used to scuttle the right of default bail, the Court stressed. \n\"First investigation is to be completed, and only then can a chargesheet or a complaint be filed within the stipulated period, and failure to do so would trigger the statutory right of default bail under Section 167(2) of Cr.PC,\" it was explained.\nThe top court observed that the factual position was missed by the trial court in the instant case, which instead of offering default bail to the accused, 'mechanically accepted the incomplete chargesheets' to continue the remand. \n\"The Investigating Agency and the trial court, thus, failed to observe the mandate of law, and acted in a manner which was manifestly arbitrary and violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the accused.\"\nAdvocates Sujay Kantawala, Sarthak Sachdeva and Santosh Sachin appeared for the petitioner. \nAdditional Solicitor General KM Nataraj, with advocates Indira Bhakar, Vatsal Joshi, Vinayak Sharma, BK Satija, Pratyush Shrivastava, and Arvind Kumar Sharma represented the respondents."}

Untouchability in a country of equal citizens, cannot be tolerated, and even if it is seen as permitted somewhere within the principles of 'Sanathana dharma', it still cannot have a space to stay, since Article 17 of the Constitution has declared that untouchability has been abolished,\" the Court said.\nThe Court was hearing a petition filed by one Elangovan, challenging a circular issued by a local government Arts College asking students to share their thoughts on the topic 'Opposition to Sanadhana' on the birth anniversary of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister and DMK party founder CN Annadurai. \nWhile the Court disposed of the plea after noting that the circular had already been withdrawn by the College and thus, the prayer in plea was infructuous, it took the opportunity to express its views on Sanatan Dharma.\n\"This Court is conscious to the very vociferous, and at time noisy debates on pro and anti Sanathana Dharma. It has also broadly understood Sanathana Dharama as a set of 'eternal duties', and that it cannot be traced to one specific literature, but has to be gathered from multiple sources which, either relate to Hinduism, or which those who practice the Hindu way of life, have come to accept. It includes the duty to the nation, duty to the King, King's duty to his people, duty to one's parents and Gurus, care for the poor, and whole lot of other duties. If the topic chosen by the impugned circular is now tested on the plane of these duties, it would then mean that all these duties are liable to be destroyed. Should not a citizen love his country? Is he not under a duty to serve his nation? Should not the parents be cared? With genuine concern for what is going round, this Court could not help pondering over it,\" Justice Seshasayee wrote in an order passed on September 15. \nThe Court went on to say that while it still encouraged the concerned college to require the students to reflect on the topic, one must keep in mind that the framers of the Constitution had consciously not made right to free speech an absolute right and instead chose to impose reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). \n\"How free speech is seen exercised these days? If the free speech madethrough the social media is taken as a basis, anyone who has little to do with science, or rocket, or space, will be lecturing on rocket science. While this is also accommodated within the right to free speech, yet it may he helpful to gain some attention, and may not take it beyond. It would be appreciable, if free speech encourages dispassionate, and healthy public debates, and help the society to move forward, along the lines which the Constitution envisages. At the end of the day, every citizen traces his existence to the Constitution, and hence it is his duty to abide by its values, its ethos, and to hold an uncompromising abidance to its spirits. This should not be forgotten. Hope it prevails,\" the Court said."}

These cases continue to reinforce the notion that women are seen as financial burdens, with their marriage prospects and associated expenses taking precedence from their very birth, often overshadowing their education and career aspirations in many parts of the country and financially weaker strata of society,\" the Court said.\nIt further observed that psychological stress and emotional trauma of one’s in-laws repeatedly asking for dowry and subjecting a woman to a life akin to a slave can be more damaging than physical violence.\n“The collective experience of victims of dowry death, as narrated through their near ones after their demise as also visible in the present case, lays bare the excruciating psychological trauma that women endure when subjected to dowry demands which mean that even after being married, they are forced and expected to keep asking their parents and families to somehow give cash or other expensive articles to the husband or his family as a matter of their right only because they are parents of a boy and the parents of a girl are duty bound to fulfil such demands of theirs,” the Court observed.\nIt said that the trauma can be so overwhelming for some women that death may appear to be a lesser agony that the relentless torment caused by the demands of dowry.\nThe Court made the observation while dealing with a plea filed by a man named Satpal Singh challenging his conviction and sentence in the suicide of his wife in May 2000.\nThe trial court had convicted Singh in April 2009 under Sections 498A (subjecting wife to cruelty) and 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and had sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years.\nJustice Sharma considered the case and noted that the deceased woman was made to endure relentless torment and was not even permitted to call her parents or visit them. \nHer phone calls to parents were rationed and she was denied basic necessities like food and clothing, the Court noted.\n“To subject a woman to a life akin to a slave merely because of her marital status is an egregious injustice… She should never become a target, facing the threat of violence or deprivation, merely because her parents cannot satisfy the insatiable demands of her in-laws,\" the Court said.  \nTherefore, the Court upheld the trial court order and said that since the convict has been on bail since 2009, he shall surrender in 30 days to serve the unexpired portion of his sentence.\nAdvocates Puruesh Buttan, Himanshu Buttan and Shivam Handa appeared for appellant Satpal Singh.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor (APP) Naresh Kumar Chahar represented the State."}

The mental and physical trauma that she would have to undergo if she were forced to carry the foetus and take on the onerous duties of motherhood is unimaginable. This Court is of the firm opinion that if the petitioner was forced to go through with the pregnancy despite the same having been caused on account of the incident of sexual assault, it would permanently scar her psyche and cause grave and irreparable injury to her mental health,” Justice Varma said in his order.\nHe further said that the Court cannot visualise a more egregious invasion of her right to life as guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution.\nThe Court was dealing with the petition by the girls’ father seeking termination of pregnancy conceived out of a sexual assault.\nIt was stated that when the family approached a hospital for advice and treatment, they were informed that they needed to approach the Court for the same.\nWhen the Court asked the counsel appearing for the hospital to obtain instructions, it was informed that a medical board has already been constituted and it has drawn up a report which said that the girl is aged 13 years and there was no foetal abnormality therefore it cannot proceed any further.\nHowever, Justice Varma held that the opinion of the board fails to take cognisance of the amendments introduced in the MTP Act which says that if the pregnancy is alleged to be on account of rape or sexual assault, the anguish caused by the pregnancy is presumed to constitute a grave injury to the woman’s mental health.\nThe Court, therefore, allowed the petition and directed the hospital to constitute a medical board to oversee the termination of pregnancy.\nIt added that the doctors will have the discretion to cancel the procedure if they find any risk to the petitioner’s life.\n“The Court further directs the respondent hospital to preserve the terminal foetus for the purposes of DNA testing which would be required with reference to the criminal case which stands registered.

It is an admitted fact that she is not the natural guardian. On the other hand, the father alone is the natural guardian.

It is clear to the extent that it is the father alone that had taken away the children from the custody of the de facto complainant’s parents,\" it was observed.\nSubjecting the petitioners to undergo the rigmarole of criminal trial would be totally unjustified leading to abuse of process of law as no offence is made out, the Court observed.\nHence, it proceeded to quash the case of kidnapping."}

She also sought compensation to the tune of ₹15 lakhs.\nThe woman told the Court that in 2014, she gave birth to a female child after being admitted to a government hospital in Mudukulathur. Since the baby developed asphyxia, both mother and child were referred to another government hospital in Paramakudi and later to another one in Madurai, where the baby unfortunately passed away.\nShe argued that the baby's death resulted from medical negligence.

He is being probed by both the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED).\nThe scam involves allegations that Delhi government officials had connived to grant liquor licenses to certain traders in exchange for bribes. The accused officials are alleged to have tweaked the excise policy to benefit certain liquor sellers.\nThe Delhi High Court had earlier denied bail to Sisodia in the cases against him by the two central agencies, prompting the AAP leader to move the Supreme Court for relief.\nDuring the course of the hearings, the bench had told the ED that a predicate offence has to pre-date the offence of money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the ED cannot create a predicate offence.\nThe CBI and the ED had earlier told the Supreme Court that they were thinking of adding AAP as an accused in the matter.\nThe bench had sought to know from the CBI and ED whether there was any evidence of bribery that could implicate Manish Sisodia in the alleged scam.\nIt had remarked that merely because lobby groups or pressure groups had called for a certain policy shift, that would not by itself imply that corruption or a crime has taken place unless there is an element of bribery involved.\nAdditional Solicitor General SV Raju appeared for the CBI and the ED.

In other words, the purpose behind enforcement of monetary orders would be to provide monetary sustenance to the victim, and not the incarceration of the aggressor. The idea is not to immediately initiate criminal proceedings against the aggressor i.e. respondent as defined in the Act for non-payment of maintenance and to send such person to prison forthwith,\" the order stated.\nIt explained that there are other specific remedies prescribed for a failure to pay monetary relief or maintenance under the DV Act. \nFor salaried persons or persons who are owed money by others, the monetary relief can be recovered either from the employer or debtor, the Court noted. \nIn other cases, the aggrieved person is expected to pursue remedies under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the Court added. \nIt, therefore, quashed a March 2019 order passed by an additional sessions judge summoning a man (petitioner) under Section 31 (1) of the DV Act for allegedly failing to pay interim maintenance to his estranged wife. \nThe wife had earlier filed a criminal case against the petitioner alleging dowry harassment, causing insult and hurt in 2016. \nThe wife later also initiated proceedings against the husband/ petitioner under the DV Act and secured an order directing him to pay maintenance of ₹45,000 to the wife and ₹55,000 to their daughter. \nLater, the wife alleged that the petitioner was not paying this maintenance amount and sought to initiate a criminal case on that ground. \nAfter the wife filed a plea for the same, the trial court passed an order summoning the petitioner before the court citing Section 31 of the DV Act. \nThis summons was challenged by the petitioner before the Delhi High Court. \nThe petitioner argued that the wife's grievances which concerned the non-compliance with an order for interim maintenance under Section 20 of the DV Act (related to monetary relief) read with Section 23 (pertaining to interim relief), could not have led to a summons under Section 31.\nSection 31 only pertains to breaches of protection orders and does not encompass violations related to monetary reliefs, the petitioner argued. \nThe wife countered that there was no infirmity with the summoning order and that the petitioner had failed to pay any maintenance despite clear orders from the trial court.\nThe High Court, however, found merit in the petitioner's submissions. \nIt pointed out that non-compliance with orders for monetary relief has to be dealt with as per Section 20(6) of DV Act and the relevant provisions of the CrPC.\nSection 31 of the DV Act exclusively deals with the breach of protection orders or interim protection orders, the Court said. \nAn order granting maintenance or monetary relief cannot be interpreted to fall within the ambit of the term \"protection order\" as used in Section 31 of the Act, the Court added. \nTherefore, the Court allowed the husband's petition and quashed the trial court order summoning him under Section 31 of the Act. \nAdvocates Prabhjit Jauhar, Gautam Panjwani, Neeraj Jain and Himanshi Nagpal represented the petitioner.\nSenior Advocate Gaurav Bhatia and Advocates Utkarsh Jaiswal, Vikas Tiwari, Shubhangi Negi and Pawan Shree Agrawal represented the respondent."}

An earlier order passed by the High Court in favour of the creditor had been disregarded by the ADM/ Collector, the Court was told. \nFurther, the Court also took critical note of an application filed by the ADM to withdraw the June 28 order passed by her, which the bench took to mean that the ADM was \"in a habit\" of exercising powers arbitrarily.\nAll of this led the Court to warn the ADM not engage in such conduct in future.\n“As a word of caution, this Court expects that in future at least the Additional District Magistrate shall follow the orders passed by the High Court and Apex Court in letter and spirit and shall not adventure in interpreting the orders on her own,\" the Court said.\nThe bench proceeded to grant the secured creditor relief and overturned the ADM's June 28 order.

On this aspect, the Court held,\n\"Enormous harm would be caused to State if they are not heard...and Centre should have made submissions to justify 10(1)(i) and what were the objects and purposes...in view of the above, Section 10(a)(i) should not have read down by this Court, especially when the constitutional validity of the Section was not in question.\"\nPertinently, the Bench also took note of the reliance placed on United States court judgments by the apex court in its 2011 judgments that read down the provision. It held,\n\"In the aforesaid two decisions without noticing the differences of the US Supreme Court (referred to in the said decisions) this Court has just followed the American decisions to which we are not agreeable. This Court ought to have considered the differences in the American laws and the Indian laws more particularly the provisions in the Indian Constitution. By the aforesaid we do not say for a moment that in a given case the US Supreme Court decisions may not be taken into consideration and/or may not be a guidance. Before following the American decisions, the Indian Courts are required to consider the difference in the nature of the laws applicable in the respective countries.\"\nJustice Karole in a separate but concurring opinion said that the US decisions relied on coud not apply to the Indian scenario.\n\"The American decisions primarily involve indictment on the basis of membership of political organizations or incidents of free speech advocating overthrow of the government. However, under Indian law, it is not membership of political organizations etc. or free speech or criticism of the government that is sought to be banned, it is only those organizations which aim to compromise the sovereignty and integrity of India and have been notified to be such and unlawful, whose membership is prohibited. This is in furtherance of the objective of the UAPA\", it was explained.\nBackground\nIn 2011, a Bench of Justices Markandey Katju and Gyan Sudha Mishra had acquitted one Arup Bhuyan, and soon after, one Indra Das, for offences under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA).\nThe top court had held that the TADA court had relied on an alleged confession statement, and mere membership of a banned organisation under the Act could not be ground for conviction.\nPertinently, the 2011 Bench, relying on its decision in State of Kerala v. Raneef as well as the American Bill of Rights and some US Supreme Court rulings, had observed in the context of the TADA Act that,\n\"In our opinion, Section 3(5) cannot be read literally otherwise it will violate Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution...Hence, mere membership of a banned organisation will not make a person a criminal unless he resorts to violence or incites people to violence or creates public disorder by violence or incitement to violence.\"\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court had observed that the larger issue in three cases should be heard by a larger bench. This led to the present reference.\nThe Union government and some state governments contended that the said proviso was effectively read down by relying on the American Bill of Rights, thus hampering the tackling of terrorism since UAPA cases were also being affected by the top court's interpretation.\nThe Central government argued that the Court could not read down the provisions of an anti-terror legislation without hearing its arguments, and by relying on possible abuse of the law.\nIt was that the Court's reliance on the Bill of Rights was misplaced, given the top court's earlier five-judge bench decision in Babulal Parate v. State of Maharashtra in which it was held,\n\" ... American doctrine cannot be imported under our Constitution because the fundamental rights guaranteed under Art. 19 (1) of the Constitution are not absolute rights but, as pointed out in State of Madras ... are subject to the restrictions placed in the subsequent clauses of Art. 19. There is nothing in the American Constitution corresponding to cls. (2) to (6) of Art. 19 of our Constitution.\"\nArguments\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Central government, had argued that official membership of banned organisations was anyways difficult to prove. The provisos read down were a deterrent and preventive measure, he added.\nThe SG had stressed that the current scheme of things could allow terrorist activity if allegedly not done under the banner of banned/terrorist organisations.\nSenior Advocate Sanjay Parikh, appearing for an intervenor-NGO, had argued that in matters involving susbtantive rights like personal liberty, provisos could be read down even when not under direct challenge.\nHe had submitted that civil liberties are a part of both Indian and American Constitutions, and therefore, it would be wrong to nullify the orders under challenge merely for relying on US court judgments."}

{"id": "id_1772", "reference_summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently struck down a provision of the Indian Military Nursing Services Ordinance, 1943 that provided for 100 percent reservation for women in Military Nursing Services [Sanjay M Peerapur & Ors vs Union of India and Ors].\nJustice Anant Ramanath Hegde highlighted that the underlying philosophy of reservation is to accommodate and include, not exclude. \n\"However, if such an accommodation which is termed as a reservation, becomes exclusive and hundred percent, without justifiable grounds, then such exclusive reservation ceases to be a reservation in its true sense and it amounts to an exclusion which is not envisaged under the Constitution at all,\" the Court added.\nThe Court was hearing a challenge by two men to a 2010 notification for the recruitment of nursing officers in the Indian Army, which excluded male candidates. The Karnataka Nurses Association was also a petitioner in the matter. \nNotably, the plea challenged the validity of Section 6 of the Indian Military Nursing Services Ordinance, 1943, which provided 100 percent reservation to women in the cadre of 'Nursing Officers'.\nThe petitioners contended that in matters of public employment, Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution, which empowers the Central government to make special provisions for women and children, has no role to play. They argued that Articles 14 (right to equality) and 16 (prohibition of discrimination in employment) would apply instead.\nFurther, they argued that the classification based on gender in Section 6 of the ordinance did not pass the twin test of reasonable and the rational nexus between the classification and the object sought to be achieved.\nThey also claimed that Section 6 of the ordinance was a temporary measure to overcome an emergency prevailing back when it was enforced, which was not relevant anymore.\nOn the other hand, the Union of India contended that exclusive reservation for women was provided to fill contingent temporary vacancies that may arise when male nursing officers, who are recruited under a separate process, may be deployed to attend soldiers during war.\nThe Union government further highlighted that exclusive reservation was also provided for men being employed as nursing officers under a separate recruitment process. As such, there is no discrimination, it was contended.\nBased on the Supreme Court's verdict in Indra Sawhney & Ors v Union of India, the High Court agreed with the petitioners' submission that in matters related to public employment, Article 16(2) overrides Article 15(3) of the Constitution.\nThe High Court further noted that the Indra Sawhney judgment had held that reservation in public employment cannot exceed more than 50 percent.\nFurthermore, the Court observed that although there may be circumstances where the very nature or place of work, or the persons for whom the work is done, require only women to be employed, the same was not pleaded by the Union government in this case.\nIn response to the government's contention that even men (through a different process) had exclusive reservation to be employed as nursing officers, the Court noted that there was no guarantee that the recruitment processes will take place simultaneously.\n\"Not going for recruitment under one Ordinance or law, when the recruitment takes place under another Ordinance or law, and if a particular sex is a disqualification to apply for the post, then it results in denial of an equal opportunity in employment guaranteed under Article 16 of the Constitution,\" the Court explained.\nThe Court noted that the Act that adopted the ordinance did not spell out objects for providing `100 percent reservation for women.\nIt stated that if the requirement was to ensure that enough women nursing officers are available to deploy on duty in hospitals to make up for temporary vacancies arising in a war situation where male nursing officers will be deployed on the battlefield, a law could be made for such a purpose in such a way that it does not violate guarantee under Article 16(2) of the Constitution of India. \n\"One of the ways probably is to provide reservation for both men and women in both units where as of now the reservation is exclusively provided either for men or women,\" the Court added.\nThe Court emphasized that women are justifiably considered to be a separate class under the Constitution but clarified that it does not mean that there can be hundred percent reservations in employment for women to the exclusion of all others, particularly when the classification is solely based on the sex without having any rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved. \n\"The law providing for exclusive reservations without any intelligible differentia having nexus to the object sought to be achieved violates the Constitutional guarantee under Article 14 and Article 16 (2) of the Constitution of India and is not saved by Article 15(3) of the Constitution,\" the Court held.\nIt further stated that the ordinance was not protected by Article 33 (by which Parliament is empowered enact laws to limit rights for certain sections of society, including members of the Indian Armed Forces) of the Constitution of India as it was not a law promulgated by the Parliament.\nAccordingly, the Court struck down the part of Section 6 giving exclusive reservations to women as unconstitutional and directed the Union government to consider the petitioners' candidature for the nursing posts.\nImportantly, the Court clarified that all earlier appointments made under ordinance and consequences flowing from such appointments will be not be affected by this verdict."}

The argument that if the husband refuses, she has to move the Court stares at us. For what purpose she has to move the Court, begs the question. The Court is neither called upon to adjudicate nor called upon to declare the status, but simply has to pronounce termination of marriage on behalf of the wife,\" the Court said.\nIt stated that the Court is not the guardian of any able adult woman in the country and that it cannot assume such a role to simply pronounce termination of marriage at the assistance of the woman.\n\"The Court in our country is not a guardian of an adult and able woman. If there is nothing for a Court to adjudicate, the Court cannot assume the role of a guardian and pronounce termination of marriage at the instance of a woman,\" the Court observed.\nPertinently, the Court underscored that the nature of khula is in the form of a ‘permissible’ action to a Muslim wife who seeks to exercise the option of terminating her marriage. As such, it cannot be conditional on the will of another.\n\"This reflects the autonomy of choice exercised by the wife. The will of the wife so expressed cannot be related to the will of the husband who has not expressed his choice to terminate the marriage. The very idea of categorization under the law, of an action as permissible, is to retain that action within the domain of the person who exercises the option, by relating it with his or her autonomy. Extending such actions to the will of another would certainly keep the action out of the category of ‘permissible’. The law being categorized so, it cannot be whittled down or constricted by the will of her husband upon whom no authority is conferred to enforce such permission,\" the Court elaborated.\nThe Court was considering a petition seeking review of its April 2021 judgment in which it had overruled a 1972 verdict to effectively restore the right of Muslim women to invoke extra-judicial divorce as set out in Muslim personal law.\nThe Court in that judgment had declared that a Muslim woman has a right to obtain a divorce by Khula, regardless of her husband's consent for the same, provided that it satisfied the following conditions:\nA declaration of repudiation or termination of marriage by the wife;\nAn offer to return dower or any other material gain received by her during marital tie; and\nAn effective attempt for reconciliation was preceded before the declaration of khula.\nIn the review petition filed by the husband, he did not dispute the authority given to the Muslim wife to invoke khula, but rather challenged the procedure acknowledged by the Court to invoke the remedy of khula by the Muslim wife.\nThe counsel for the review petitioner and a Muslim scholar turned lawyer, advocate CS Hussain, contended that if a Muslim wife wishes to terminate her marriage with her husband, she has to demand talaq from her husband and on his refusal, she has to move the qazi or a Court. \nWhile the Quranic verse relating to khula found in Chapter 2, verse 229, declares that a Muslim wife has the right to terminate her marriage, the counsel based the arguments on a reported Hadith, illustrating an instance of termination of marriage at the instance of a wife during the lifetime of the Prophet Mohammed in which a settlement was reached at the instance of the Prophet. \nThe Court did not concur with these arguments as it opined that the situations in the illustrated cases and Hadiths cannot be ignored. The Court clarified that it is not invalidating the procedure of arriving at a settlement between spouses on demand of the wife but is stating that a situational procedure cannot be treated as law.\n\"We reiterate that that procedure is most desirable for parties. We also clarify our judgment to that extent. However, we cannot hold that that procedure followed situationally, be treated as a law when parties are not able to arrive at such a settlement. If the procedure itself is understood as the law, that would derogate from the right conferred on a Muslim wife, under Quranic legislation, to terminate the marriage at her will,\" the Court said.\nIt also pointed out that the relief of declaration of status based on divorce can be given only when divorce is effected through an extra judicial method. It noted that in a judicial divorce in the nature of faskh, the courts are deciding the cause on the premise of fault. \n\"If the arguments of the review petitioner is accepted that the court will have to pronounce termination of marriage, then the claim for khula would turn on fault. The very nature of khula has always been recognised as a mode of divorce on a no-fault basis\", the Court said.\nIt further observed that if the arguments of the petitioner is accepted, Muslim women in India will be confronted with the situation where no solution would be available to them to effectuate their right to obtain divorce, conferred on her as per Quranic legislation\nTherefore, it dismissed the plea."}

After that, the couple will have to wait for another 30 days to solemnise the marriage.\nJustice VG Arun questioned whether these requirements are essential 69 years after the Act was enacted, especially in light of technological advances.\n\"Whether this waiting period is essential in view of the revolutionary changes in the information technology sector and changes in the social set up itself are matters that should engage the attention of the law makers,\" the Court's order stated.\nThe single-judge directed the Central and State governments to file their counter affidavits in the matter wihtin a month and added,\n\"A lot of changes and liberalisation has taken place even in our customs and practices. Yet another aspect is that a large number of youngsters are employed abroad. Such people come back to their native place only on short vacations and instances are many where the marriage is conducted during the short holidays.\" \nThe order was passed on a plea moved by a yet-to-be-married couple who had submitted the notice of their intended marriage on January 5 this year to the respondent marriage officer.\nThe petitioners moved the Court challenging Section 5 of the Act that prescribes the 30-day period.\nThey contended that the same is unconstitutional, arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.\nIt was pointed out that the only purpose of notice of intended marriage is to enable any person to object to the marriage on the ground that the marriage would contravene any of the conditions mentioned in Section 4 of the Act.\nHowever, since any such contraventions can be ascertained by other means or by conducting an enquiry as provided under Section 8, the petitioners argued that there is no justification in waiting for 30 days calling for objections from the public.\nThey also argued that the 30-day notice period is merely directory in nature and not mandatory, even though a division bench of the High Court had held it to be mandatory in another case.\nFurther, the petitioners pointed out that when the statute was enacted in 1954, technological advancements especially in communication were not as developed as they are now.\n\"The advancement of technology, facilities of easy enquiry and change in social conditions are relevant for interpretation of the provisions. It would be unreasonable to force the present generation living with current advancements to follow the norms and period adopted by earlier generations due to conditions prevailing then,\" the plea said.\nSince one half of the couple has to return to Muscat for work on January 24, the petitioners sought interim relief from the court in the form of a direction to the marriage officer to conduct an enquiry and register the marriage without waiting for 30 days.\nHowever, Deputy Solicitor General of India (DSGI) S Manu submitted that the statutory provision has been in force for more than half a century and cannot, therefore, be overlooked for granting the interim relief.\nGovernment Pleader S Appu's arguments were also in line with that of the DSGI.\nWith regard to the interim relief sought by the petitioners, the Court deemed it improper to grant the same saying,\n\"As rightly contended by the learned DSG, grant of an interim order will have the effect of stay of operation of the provision.... This court cannot also ignore the Division Bench and Single Bench decisions holding the time stipulated in Section 5 to be mandatory. For the aforementioned reasons, the prayer for interim relief is declined,\" the court explained.\nThe matter will be taken up again after a month by which time the Central and State governments are expected to file counter affidavits.\nThe petitioners were represented by advocates KM Firoz and Geo Paul."}

In view of the final judgment, the retirements of chairpersons, vice-chairpersons and members of tribunals shall be in accordance with the applicable rules. \nThe ruling came in a petition filed by Madras Bar Association (MBA) challenging the 2020 Rules for violating the principle of separation of powers and independence of judiciary.\nThe petition stated that the 2020 Rules posed a threat to the independence of the judiciary and to effective and efficient administration of justice. The Rules, the plea said, were ex-facie against the decisions of the Supreme Court, particularly Rojer Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd.\nThis was the second instance of such rules being challenged before the Supreme Court.\nThe first was in 2017, when the Central government had notified similar rules for tribunals and appellate tribunals and similar authorities. These came to be assailed in the Rojer Mathew case. \nThe 2017 Rules were framed under the provisions of the Finance Act, 2017 which itself was challenged before the Supreme Court on the ground that the Act was passed as a Money Bill, thereby, circumventing legislature. \nWhile a five-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court referred the question of passage of the Finance Act as Money Bill to a larger Bench and the same remains pending still, the 2017 Rules were struck down for violation of separation of powers and independence of judiciary.\nHowever, the Court, in that case, upheld Section 184 of the Finance Act which had entitled the Central government to frame rules to determine appointment, service conditions, removal and other aspects of tribunals. It ordered the Centre to reformulate new rules in consonance with earlier an earlier judgment of the court in R Gandhi.\nSubsequently, the 2020 Rules came to be notified. The 2020 Rules, the petitioner association had contended, were in contravention of separation powers and the principles laid down in 2018 judgment.\nOne of the points of contention in the petition was that the 2020 Rules provide for a four-year tenure for the members appointed to tribunals. This figure of four years is not only in violation of the Supreme Court judgments of SP Sampat Kumar and Rojer Mathew, but will also disincentivise lawyers from seeking appointment, it was argued by Senior Counsel Arvind Datar on behalf of MBA. \nHe also contended that should the Court decide in favour of upholding the 2020 Rules, then aspects such as four-year tenure for members, ineligibility of advocates for consideration for some tribunals, ILS members made eligible for presiding position, among others, need to be reconsidered.\nOn the last day of the hearing, Attorney General KK Venugopal submitted that the Supreme Court in Rojer Mathew v. South Indian Bank Ltd had upheld Section 184 of the Finance Act according to which the tenure should not exceed five years and Rules were in consonance with that requirement. \nHe pointed out that the vacuum created by quashing of 2017 Rules was sought to be filled by the 2020 Rules. \nSenior Counsel Siddharth Luthra and CS Vaidanathan appeared for two applicants while Senior Advocate AS Chandhiok represented NCLT and NCLAT Bar Association."}

The Secretary, TNPSC].\nJustice Battu Devanand noted that while writing an essay on the “importance of conversation of natural resources”, it may be natural for young persons to spontaneously become emotional and feel patriotic.\nHence, he opined that the candidate’s answer sheet could not be invalidated merely because she wrote “Jai Hind” at the end of her paper, which the judge observed meant “victory to India” and was a commonly uttered slogan, whether it is at the end of prayers by school children or speeches by eminent persons.\n“In such a moment of reflection and soul searching, for some youth, it's a natural way of expression to end an essay or a speech with some patriotic slogan summarizing the essence of the topic such as ‘Jai Hind.’ So, in this case, ‘Jai Hind - Let us live united with nature’ appears to be a natural, spontaneous and effective culmination of the essay on the given topic rather than any tacit signal of attempting any malpractice,” the Court said.\nThe judge also recounted that ‘Jai Hind’ was coined by the Indian revolutionary Champaka Raman Pillai during British rule in 1907. Its importance grew after Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose immortalised it as a battle cry for his Indian National Army (INA), the Court added.\n“It is the last word to be seen in several communications wherever the patriotic fervour is invoked towards the motherland i.e., India or Bharat,” the judge further observed.\nThe Court, therefore, directed the TNPSC to roll back its decision to invalidate the candidate’s answer paper in this case and evaluate her essay to determine whether she would make the cut off to be selected as a candidate.\nThe exam in question for Group-II services took place in November 2014.\nThe candidate before the Court had also attended an interview and counselling round in 2015, before she was told that she did not make the cut as she only secured 184 marks, which was 6 marks short of the required 190 marks.\nAfter inquiries, the candidate came to know in 2016 that her answer sheet during the essay round was invalidated in its entirety because she had made “irrelevant” or “impertinent” remarks at the end of her essay. The TNPSC said that this was in violation of its instructions to exam candidates. \nThe candidate, however, maintained that her closing remarks were relevant to the essay she had written in answer to the question, \"Write a detailed account on importance and conservation of natural resources.”\nTherefore, she moved a petition before the High Court for relief. The Court found merit in her stance, observing,\n“Those persons, who are having the idea of ‘patriotism’, definitely safeguard the natural resources for the benefit of the future generations ... There is no any dispute that we have to live with the nature. As such, while writing essay, on the issue of importance and conservation of natural resources, at conclusion writing as ‘Jai Hind – Let us live united with nature’ by the petitioner is very relevant.”\nThe Court, therefore, struck down the TNPSC’s decision to reject her answer paper in a ‘routine’ manner as illegal and unconstitutional.\nThe TNPSC was ordered to evaluate the candidate’s essay and appoint her to the post if she makes the cut off within four weeks after it receives a copy of the November 6 order.\nAdvocate G Karthik appeared for the petitioner-candidate. Standing counsel V Panneer Selvam appeared for the TNPSC."}

She asked for her regular hairdresser but since she was not available, another stylist was assigned.\nWhat according to her was a simple haircut, took over an hour, and Roy was in “utter shock” when she saw that the stylist had “chopped off her entire hair leaving only 4 inches from the top and barely touching to her shoulders”, which was against her instructions.\nSubsequently, she was offered hair treatment free of cost by the hotel, to which she is said to have agreed after a lot of persuasion.\nHowever, post treatment, she alleged her hair turned “hard and rough” in addition to an itchy and burnt scalp. She later tried to seek the assistance of the hotel staff in the matter but alleged that they were “abusive, rude and disrespectful” and she was threatened.\nRoy stated that she even approached the management of ITC Group and Hotels in vain. She, therefore, filed the plea alleging deficiency in service on the part of opposite parties and sought written apology from the ITC Management besides ₹3 crore in compensation alleging harassment, humiliation and mental trauma.\nThe NCDRC initially awarded her ₹2 crores, holding that owing to the haircut against Roy’s instructions, by the hotel’s salon, she lost her prospective assignments and “suffered a huge loss” that completely changed her lifestyle and “shattered her dream to be a top model”.\nITC Hotels were also held guilty of medical negligence in hair treatment.\nThe hotel then moved the top court challenging the same.\nThe Supreme Court in February this year set aside the compensation amount and remitted the matter for fresh determination of the amount.\nThe top court had made it clear that the same has to be based on evidence and not based solely on the claim raised by the consumer.\nIn its latest order, the NCDRC at the outset stated that the finding of deficiency in service by the hotel has been affirmed by the top court, and hence attained finality. \nIt considered application forms for a ₹1 crore hair modelling assignment, and emails by corporates and VLCC for lucrative advertisement and other campaigns into account.\nThe petitioner appeared in-person.\nSenior Advocate Debal Kumar Banerji with advocates LK Bhushan and Raashi Beri appeared for the respondents."}

Union of India].\nSingle judge bench of Justice Sandeep K Shinde said that the instructions relied upon by the Railways in this regard, cannot be said to be ‘mandatory’ and would not render, proper season ticket, automatically invalid for non-production of identity card.\n\"Passenger producing proper season ticket without, identify card, ipso-facto, would not render season ticket, improper and/or invalid, unless, it is proved that passenger was using season ticket, that was issued in the name of another person,\" the Court said. \nThe decision came in an appeal challenging Railway Claims Tribunal's order which rejected compensation to the appellant Harish Damodar who had sustained injuries sustained after an accidental fall from the train due to heavy rush of passengers. \nWhile rejecting compensation, the tribunal had observed that Damodar's injuries did not seem to be from an 'untoward incident' but seemed 'self-inflicted'.\nThe tribunal had also concluded that the appellant was not a bonafide passenger as he had not carried an identity proof along with his monthly season ticket and hence it was considered that he did not have a proper pass. \nThe question before the High Court was whether, for want of identity card, season ticket carried and possessed by the applicant-passenger, would be invalid?\nThe Central government had placed reliance on instructions issued by the Railway Ministry which mandated that it is necessary for the passenger to produce the identity card along with the season ticket failing which the season ticket will be invalid and passenger will be treated without ticket.\nThe Court, however, said that non-production of identity card along with the season ticket by a passenger, who had sustained injury due to accidental fall, itself would not render valid season ticket, invalid.\nIn this regard the Court said,\n\"First reason is that, applicant was travelling with valid and proper season ticket. Therefore, he was “Passenger” within the meaning of Section 2(29) of the Act. Second reason is, instructions relied on by the Railways, cannot be said to be ‘mandatory’ and therefore would not render, proper season ticket, automatically invalid for non-production of identity card.\"\nFurther, in terms of provisions of Section 54 of the Railways Act of 1989, every passenger shall, on demand by any railway servant present his “pass” or “ticket” to such railway servant for examination during the journey. \nTherefore, passenger producing proper season ticket without, identify card, ipso-facto, would not render season ticket, improper and/or invalid, unless, it is proved that passenger was using season ticket, that was issued in the name of another person, the Court explained. \nAlthough Section 53 of the Act prohibits transfer of ‘certain tickets’ however, it was not respondent’s case that, season ticket produced by the applicant was issued in the name of another person.\n\"Appellant had produced the valid season ticket bearing his signature and also journey extension tickets, which bore season ticket no.62490200. The signature of the appellant on season ticket, was not disputed by the Railways. Moreover, season ticket and the journey extension tickets, were recovered, from the appellant while removing him at Hospital. In the circumstances, non-production of Identity Card along with season ticket, itself would not render proper season ticket, invalid,\" the Court ruled. \nThe Court, therefore, directed the tribunal to decide the compensation claim of the appellant in terms of the Railway Accidents and Untoward Incidents (Compensation) Rules preferably before July of this year. \nDamodar was directed to appear before the Mumbai bench of the tribunal for hearing on June 10."}

The 1966 Act was also based on the same principle, it was submitted. \nThe SGPC argued that the State had taken away its right to administer of Gurdwaras and associated properties.\nThe Bench in its judgment dealt with the following questions of law that thus arose:\nWhether Section 72 of the Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966 and Sections 3 and 4 of the Inter-state Corporation Act, 1957 were transitional provisions to meet the immediate requirement of the issues arising out of creation of separate States?\nThe top court said that even 1966 Act had not barred the State government from legislating on items under List II of the Seventh Schedule or even in List III of the Seventh Schedule, subject to the limitations as prescribed in the Constitution.\n\"The consistent view of the three Full Benches of the High Court and of this Court is that the power of the Centre to issue directions under Section 72 of the 1966 Act is a transitional provision. Therefore, we have no hesitation to hold that the power of the Centre to issue directions under Section 72 of the 1966 Act is indeed a transitional provision to ensure smooth and continuous functioning of a body corporate so that it is not paralyzed on becoming an inter-State body corporate due to reorganisation of the erstwhile State of Punjab. The directions contemplated by Section 72 relates to functioning and operation of such body corporate. A competent State legislature is not deprived of its power to legislate on the subjects falling within its jurisdiction in terms of List II of the Seventh Schedule.\"\nWhether the enactment (Haryana Act) falls within the legislative competence of the Haryana State Legislature or it falls in Entry 44 of List I (Union List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution?\nThe Bench ruled that the 2014 Act falls within the legislative competence of the State of Haryana.\n\" ... any law dealing with charities, charitable institutions and endowments falls within List III [of the seventh schedule]. Such law contemplated by List III is a regulatory law to regulate the functioning of charitable institutions or charitable and religious endowments and religious institutions. Whereas, incorporation of a statutory body falls in Entry 32 of List II, as also unincorporated religious and other societies.\"\nIt was made clear that the transitional provisions of the earlier Acts do not impinge upon the legislative competence of the Haryana State legislature to enact a law on the subject at hand. \nWhether, the Act falls in List-III (Concurrent List) Schedule VII, which required the assent of the President of India as per Article 254(2) of the Constitution of India, and in the absence of such assent, void?\nThe Bench outright dismissed this question as it noted that the Haryana Act does not fall under Entry 28 (charitable institutions, religious endowments/institutions) of List III of the Seventh Schedule.\nWhether any fundamental rights of the petitioners under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India are violated, so as to entitle the petitioners to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 32 of the Constitution?\nThe Bench ruled that the affairs of gurdwaras in the State are required to be managed by local committees and since the committee comprises of Sikhs alone, the rights under Articles 25 and 26 are not violated. \n\"Since the affairs of the Sikh minority in the State are to be managed by the Sikhs alone, therefore, it cannot be said to be violative of any of the fundamental rights conferred under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution.\"\nSenior Advocate Rakesh Dwivedi with advocates Jasbir Singh Malik, Ritesh Khatri, Usha Nandini V, and Gagan Gupta appeared for the petitioners. \nAdditional Solicitor-General KM Nataraj appeared for the Union government. \nSenior Advocates Shyam Divan appeared for the Haryana government.

{"id": "id_227", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court Thursday ruled that the Kerala Governor, being the ex-officio Chancellor of Kannur University, is not bound by the advice of the Kerala government's Council of Ministers when it comes to appointing Vice-Chancellors to the University [Dr Premachandran Keezhoth and anr vs The Chancellor Kannur University and anr].\nA bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) DY Chandrachud with Justices JB Pardiwala and Manoj Misra stressed that under the Kannur University Act of 1996, the Chancellor is the sole judge when it comes to Vice-Chancellor (VC) appointments, and not a mere titular head.\n\"It is the Chancellor who has been conferred with the competence under the Act, 1996 to appoint or reappoint a Vice-Chancellor. No other person even the Pro-Chancellor or any superior authority can interfere with the functioning of the statutory authority and if any decision is taken by a statutory authority at the behest or on a suggestion of a person who has no statutory role to play, the same would be patently illegal,\" the Court concluded. \nIn the selection of the Vice-Chancellor, the Chancellor's opinion is final in all respects, the Court held. Even when it comes to reappointing the Vice-Chancellor, the main consideration to prevail upon the Chancellor is the interest of the university, the Court added.\nThe Supreme Court made the observations while quashing the reappointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University.\nThe re-appointment of Dr. Raveendran as the Kannur Vice-Chancellor had been embroiled in political controversy ever since it was first announced in 2021.\nAfter he was re-appointed, the Kerala Governor Mohammed Arif Khan claimed that he was pressured by the CPI (M)-led State government to sign off on the re-appointment.\nMeanwhile, the appointment was challenged by Dr. Premachandran Keezhoth before the Kerala High Court on the ground that Dr. Raveendran was over the age limit of 60 years when he was reappointed to the post. Dr. Raveendran was 61 years old at the time of his reappointment.\nThe High Court upheld Dr. Raveendran's reappointment, which was challenged before the Supreme Court in appeal.\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court ruled that the age limit of 60 years only applied to fresh appointments and not reappointments.\nHowever, since the State government was found to have excessively interfered in the 2021 reappointment of Dr. Raveendran, the same was set aside and the appeal against the Kerala High Court's decision was allowed.\nThe Supreme Court explained that there are several other functions performed by the Governor under the Constitution of India where he is bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers. \nHowever, the Court pointed out that the Kannur University Act makes a clear-cut distinction between the roles played by the elected government and the Governor when it comes to the appointment of a Vice-Chancellor. \nThe Court proceeded to rule that while performing the function of the University Chancellor, the Governor acts \"only in his personal capacity\", which is different from his role as the titular head of a State. \n\"The powers and duties exercised and performed by him under a statute related to the University, as its Chancellor, have absolutely no relation to the exercise and performance of the powers and duties by him while he holds office as the Governor of the State.\"\nIn other words, the Chancellor is not bound by the advice of Ministers when it comes to appointing the Vice-Chancellor of Kannur University, the Court said.\nInterestingly, the Court found that although the Kerala Governor, being the University's Chancellor, had an important role to play in Vice-Chancellor appointments, he appeared to have not applied his independent mind when it came to Dr. Raveendran's reappointment.\nExpressing disapproval over the apparent failure to do so, the Court said, \n\"The Chancellor was required to discharge his statutory duties in accordance with law and guided by the dictates of his own judgment and not at the behest of anybody else. Law does not recognise any such extra constitutional interference in the exercise of statutory discretion. Any such interference amounts to dictation from political superior and has been condemned by courts on more than one occasions.\"\nThe Court also said it was perplexed by the Kerala Governor's submission before the top court that the reappointment was not valid primarily because it violated University Grants Commission (UGC) norms. \nThe Court pointed out that the Governor need not have cited UGC norms when it was the Governor who was required to independently apply his mind under the Kannur University Act. \n\"The UGC Regulations are silent in so far as reappointment of the Vice-Chancellor is concerned,\" the Court further noted."}

Pavittar Singh in which it was held that maintenance is a statutory right, which the legislature has framed irrespective of nationality, cast or creed of the parties.\n\"The statutory liability under Section 125 is, therefore, distinct from the liability under any other law..... Therefore, giving effect to an agreement, which overrides this provision of law, that is, Section 125 of CrPC would tantamount to not only giving recognition to something, which is opposed to public policy, but would also amount to negation of it,\" the Court made it clear.\nSuch an agreement in addition to it being against public policy would also be against the clear intendment of this provision, the Court further said. \nThe Court was hearing a plea filed by a wife challenging orders of a trial court, which on June 26, 2019 denied her maintenance on the ground that she had entered into an agreement with her husband that her expenses would be looked after by her parents, till the time she stayed at her parental house.\nThe couple had gotten married on March 10, 2016. Within three months, the wife claimed that she was subjected to torture by the husband and her in-laws and there were dowry demands.\nThe wife lodged a criminal case and then the husband and his parents tried to settle the case. While settling the case, the wife allegedly agreed that till the time she would stay at her parents' house, her expenses would be looked after her by parents.\nShe alleged that the husband never returned to take her back to the matrimonial house and accordingly, she sought maintenance for herself as she was pursuing her undergraduate studies.\nOn the other hand, the husband alleged that the wife was leading an adulterous life. He relied upon the personal diary of the wife, wherein she had confessed to having some inclination towards another man prior to the marriage.\nThe husband also cited the existence of the agreement. \nThe trial court rejected the argument of the husband regarding adultery stating that that the wife had such feelings for another person prior to her marriage and not after marriage with the husband and thus, it couldn't be said that she was leading an adulterous life.\nDespite that, the trial court ruled against the wife leading to the present appeal before the High Court. \nThe High Court noted that the wife was living at her parental house since January 2017 and that the husband hasn't provided any maintenance to her since then despite the fact that she was pursuing her education.\n\"Peculiarly, in his cryptic written objection, he has not narrated any detail as to under what circumstances, she began to reside in the parental house and as to why the FIR was also filed against him and simply it is stated that the matter has been settled between the parties. Such an evasive denial on the part of the husband itself indicates that he has not taken proper care of his wife, while she was in her parental house,\" the Court said.\nThe judge further noted that plea of the husband itself revealed that he had not bothered to maintain his legally married wife though he admitted that she was a college student with no source of income. \n\"More so, her husband did not even hesitate to raise the plea of adultery, simply on the expression she recorded in her diary that she had some inclination to another person, prior to her marriage,\" the bench added.\nAs regards the agreement, the Court said the same would be void in view of Section 125 CrPc. \nThe judge noted that the husband was a teacher in a school and was earning around ₹22,000 per month. \n\"Going by the provisions of the Act and the pleadings and evidence on record and legal proposition, it can be held that the husband has not been able to prove that he has no sufficient means to discharge his obligation and that he did not neglect or refused to maintain his wife, whereas the wife has been able to prove that there is neglect on his part to maintain his legally married wife,\" the bench said.\nIt, therefore, set aside the trial court order and directed the trial court to consider the matter afresh.\n\"Both the parties are directed to appear before the learned trial Court on June 14, 2022, to receive further order from the court,\" the High Court said. \nAdvocates A Dutta and A Ganguly appeared for the wife while the husband was represented by advocate R K Bhatra."}

However, the husband alleged that the wife left the matrimonial home after only four months of marriage.\nIt was stated that she filed a police complaint alleging that a huge amount of dowry was given and further exorbitant demands were being made by the parents of the husband.\nThe Court was told that in December 2009, the wife also tried to commit suicide by consuming mosquito repellent liquid.\nAfter considering the allegations, the Bench noted that even though the wife had claimed that she was forced to write the suicide note, in her cross examination she admitted that her husband was not even home when she attempted to commit suicide.\nThe Bench further noted that the wife had filed several complaints and that even though many such cases ended in acquittal, she kept filing appeals to ensure that he and his family members are put in jail.\n“The appellant, no doubt has a legal right to take recourse for the wrong that may have been committed but making unsubstantiated allegations of having been subjected to dowry demands or acts of cruelty by the respondent or his family members, and getting criminal trials initiated against the respondent are clearly acts of cruelty,\" the Court observed. \nThe Court ultimately concluded that in this case, during two years of their matrimonial life, the parties barely resided together for ten months and that even during that time, there were various acts of the cruelty, including the initiation of false complaints, civil and criminal litigation committed by the wife towards the husband.\n“We therefore, conclude that the learned Addl.

State of Maharashtra]\nSingle-judge Justice CV Bhadang noted in his judgment that such incidents happen due to the blind faith of devotees on people like the accused; and the evidence in such cases also has to be appreciated in the context of the peculiar factual matrix. \n\"It is significant to note that the blind faith of the parties/victim on the accused is the real driver in such cases. The evidence in such cases has to be appreciated in the context of these peculiar circumstances\" the judgment said.\nThe female devotee and her husband had allegedly been suggested to approach the accused to resolve their problems of having a child post their marriage.\nWhile the initial visits of the couple in 2013 would involve the accused giving them' vibhuti' and chanting of mantras, in 2015, the accused advised the couple to have a ‘reiki procedure’. \nEssentially, the couple was required to have physical relations in the presence of the convict. \nAlthough the woman had her reservations, due to her husband's faith and devotion, they completed the procedure as was required of them. This supposedly happened five times. \nOn one such occasion, in the year 2016, the convict asked the husband to leave the room as he wanted to conduct a certain procedure on the woman. \nWhen the husband left the room, the wife was allegedly sexually abused by the accused. Post this incident, the woman filed a complaint against the accused. \nThe accused came to be charged under Section 376 (rape) and 354 (sexual assault) of the Indian Penal Code and provisions of the Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication Human Sacrifice and Other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practices and Black Magic Act.\nThe trial concluded and the accused was sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for ten years and with a fine.\nThe accused argued that the offences against him were false. It was highly improbable that accused could suggest or insist for any such procedure referred to as reiki. \nHe argued that the couple was staying with family members and in any case, having physical relations in the close proximity of a husband was improbable. \nThe accused submitted that the woman had an issue from her first marriage, so it was unlikely that the couple would visit the accused for a child. \nThe prosecution on the other hand supported the trial court judgment. It was argued that the evidence of the couple was consistent and inspired confidence. There was circumstantial evidence that indicated that the accused-appellant professed that he was a devotee of Macchindranath and there were devotees who were assembling at the house of the appellant every Thursday.\nTheir case was that the \"incident of present nature is a result of blind faith kept by so called devotees who out of their personal or family problems, seek such advice from the persons claiming to have super natural powers\". \nIt was submitted that the complainant and her husband had no reason to falsely implicate the accused. \nThe Court was not convinced with the arguments of the accused on the aspect of improbability.\nThe Court noted that the husband had deep faith on the accused and it was only due to such faith that the couple underwent physical relations in front of the accused, \"which could otherwise be quite embarrassing\".\nThe woman was aware of the faith of her husband on the accused and therefore, it might have been plausible that she might not have found anything unusual and might not have objected when the husband was asked to go out on the date of the incident, the Court noted. \nThe Judge, however, noted that the incident had occurred before the amendment to Section 376 of the IPC in 2018 when the prescribed sentence was of 7 years.

The court clerk or court munshi could post the summons on the WhatsApp group besides serving the same in person in the usual mode, the Court had suggested.\nThe Court has now stood by this earlier recommendation. \n“This Court is hopeful that these officers must have contemplated over this thought wherein creation of WhatsApp Group was suggested by this Court,” the Court said in its September 21 order. \nThe Court also added to its earlier suggestions, noting that when WhatsApp groups are created, the creation of such a group can be referred to an order passed by the trial court. \nOnce the trial is over, the groups can be deleted, the Court pointed out. \n“Privacy and dignity/decency of the members of the WhatsApp Group be maintained, so that it may be available only as tool for facilitation of trial rather than for any other purpose,” the Court added in its latest order. \nThe Court passed the directions while hearing a matter related to a murder case dating back to 2018. The trial in the case has been delayed due to the non-appearance of witnesses.\n“Almost four and half years have passed since then, but trial is not being completed.

Therefore, conditional liberty must override the statutory embargo on the grant of bail under Section 37 of the NDPS Act, he held. \n“From the above [judgments cited], it is apparent that inspite of the stringent test to be met by the accused under Section 37 of the NDPS for being released on bail, it has been held that the same does not fetter grant of Bail to the accused on the ground of undue delay in the completion of trial. It has been held that prolonged incarceration generally militates against the right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and therefore, the conditional liberty must override the statutory embargo under Section 37 of the NDPS Act,” the Court said. \nThe Court made these observations while granting bail to two persons, Vishwajeet Singh and Dev Kumar @ Golu, who were caught with 12 kg ganja (cannabis) each.\nThey were arrested in December 2020 and the trial court framed charges against them on December 7, 2021, under Section 20(c) read with Section 29 of the NDPS Act.\nJustice Chawla considered the case and noted that the trial against the accused was not likely to conclude anytime soon and that the accused men have been in jail for a long time.\n“I also notice that it is not the case of the prosecution that the Applicants are involved in any other case of similar nature or other criminal cases.

The survivor-girl claimed that the the accused provided her with alcohol and engaged in non-consensual sexual intercourse with her at a guest house.\nThe prosecution further alleged that the accused resorted to blackmail and threatened to share inappropriate photographs of the survivor on social media. Using such threats, he was alleged to have forcefully engaged the victim in sexual acts multiple times.\nIn April 2021, the survivor discovered she was pregnant and informed her mother, who contacted the accused. \nThe accused, in response, is alleged to have threatened both the survivor and her mother. He also allegedly coerced them into signing marriage documents, following which he began living with the survivor in a rented place.\nHowever, the accused is stated to have beaten and abused the survivor after the marriage and also pressurised her to get an abortion. \nAfter an FIR was filed, the pregnancy was terminated, the Court was told.\nSubsequently, the accused approached the High Court to quash the FIR.\nThe counsel for petitioner (accused) argued that it was a case of a love affair and that there was a consensual relationship between the parties. The parties had married to each other out of their own will, and the family of the survivor was in constant touch with the accused, the Court was further told. \nIt was also contended that since both the parties were Muslims, they are governed by Muslim personal law. As per Muslim law, a marriage between the two parties is valid since the girl has already attained the age of 15 years, the Court was told.\nThe Court, in turn, noted that the issue of whether a Muslim girl attaining 15 years of age would be governed by the provisions of the POCSO Act or not, is pending for consideration before the Supreme Court. \nHowever, since the alleged sexual abuse was stated have started before the marriage, the High Court said that it is not going into the aspect of whether the marriage was valid. \n\"In any case, in the present case, the allegations of rape are not after the marriage but before the marriage between the parties, and this Court is not going into the aspect of the validity of marriage of the present petitioner with the victim,\" the Court's order stated.\nThe State government also opposed the petitioner's plea, contending that the survivor had supported the allegations of sexual assault in her statement before the magistrate. \nFurther, the Court also noted that the survivor had also denied giving consent for sexual relations with the accused. \nThe Court added that even if the survivor, who was a minor at the time of the alleged offence, had said that she had given consent, the rape case against the accused cannot be quashed since \"the consent of a minor was of no consequence for the purpose of sexual relationship.\"\nThe Court proceeded to dismiss the case after opining that a prima facie case had been made out against the petitioner. \nThe petitioner was represented by advocates Ankit Rana, Rahul Sand and Sudhir Kumar.

The appellant has criminal antecedents, and he continued in the similar criminal activities thereafter also. Hence, in the interest of justice and society at large the appellant does not deserve any leniency.\" The Court observed. \nThe Court observed that Abdul Rauf had no personal animosity or grudge against the deceased.

It is relevant to note that under Section 7 of the POCSO Act, ‘touch’ is a separate offence. If the submission raised by the learned APP that a touch would amount to manipulation is accepted, then Section 7 of the Act would be rendered redundant,\" the Court said.\nAs per Section 3(c) of the POCSO Act, a person is said to commit \"penetrative sexual assault\" if he manipulates any part of the child’s body so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus, or any other body part or makes the child to do so with him or any other person.\nThe Court was hearing a plea moved by a man who had challenged his conviction and 10-year-jail sentence for the rape of a 6-year-old girl.\nThe accused man was alleged to have touched the anal part of the victim when she went to attend tuition classes conducted by his brother. The girl later complained of pain when sitting down and disclosed the incident to her parents, who then filed a criminal complaint.\nIn 2020, a trial court convicted the accused for rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault under Section 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012. This verdict was challenged by the accused before the High Court. \nThe High Court found that there were several inconsistencies in the evidence, which cast doubt on whether the accused had committed penetrative sexual assault under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. This included material improvements in the victim's statements regarding the incident. \n“In her statement during the MLC as well as her statement recorded under Section 161 of the CrPC, the victim has consistently stated that the appellant touched her anal region with his finger through her clothes. However, in her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC, she has stated that the appellant inserted his whole finger inside her anal region and also held her throat and threatened her,” the Court observed.\nThe Court further pointed out that the victim eventually alleged that the accused man had cut her anal region with his fingernails. However, in earlier statements, she only mentioned that the accused had touched her over her clothes. \n“It cannot be disregarded that the victim at time of incident was a child of six years and therefore, some leeway has to be provided for minor inconsistencies in her statement. However, from the analysis above, it cannot be stated that the contradictions in the statements of the victim are minor or immaterial,” the Court said.\nNevertheless, the Court found that the charge of aggravated sexual assault under Section 10 was proven against the accused beyond any reasonable doubt.\n“There is nothing in the present case to show that there was any manipulation on any part of the body of the victim so as to cause penetration...Therefore, the appeal is partially allowed and the impugned judgment is modified to the extent that instead of Section 6 of the POCSO Act, the appellant stands convicted under Section 10 of the POCSO Act,” the Court held.\nAs a result, the Court reduced the accused man's sentence to 5 years of rigorous imprisonment for the offence of aggravated sexual assault under Section 10 of the POCSO Act.

The outside public has no means to have any access while policies are framed. The policies are framed under the supervision of the political heads by the senior bureaucrats,\" Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma observes. The senior bureaucrats in the present case are saying that no discussion took place on the material points like the increase of margin from 5% to 12%,\" the Court noted.\nThe Court finally concluded that Sisodia not only failed to pass the twin conditions provided under Section 45 of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, but he has also not been able to cross the triple test for grant of bail. \n\"I consider, in view of the discussion made hereinabove, the petitioner is not entitled to bail,\" the Court concluded. \nIt is alleged that officials of the Delhi government had connived to grant liquor licenses to certain traders in exchange for bribes.\nThe central agencies' case is that the excise policy was tweaked and the profit margins changed to benefit certain traders. Kickbacks were received in exchange for the same, it is further alleged.\nThe ED and the CBI registered cases in relation to the alleged scam after Delhi Lieutenant Governor (LG) VK Saxena recommended a CBI probe based on a report by the Delhi Chief Secretary. The report claimed that Sisodia violated statutory provisions and notified a policy that had significant financial implications.\nAlthough Sisodia was not named in the CBI's chargesheet initially, the CBI filed an additional chargesheet later arraying him as an accused in the case.\nIt is Sisodia's stance that the policy and the changes made in it were approved by the LG and that CBI is now going after the policy decisions of an elected government.\nHis lawyers have argued that no money has been traced to the senior AAP leader and that the agencies are re-evaluating a liquor policy that was formulated by the elected government and approved by the Lieutenant Governor (LG).\nThe allegation against Nair is that he was the person to whom the alleged kickback amount of ₹100 crore was transferred or delivered by the South liquor lobby. \nBoinpally has been accused of lobbying for certain liquor businessmen based in southern India. It is also alleged that he was part of a conspiracy in pursuance of which he transferred money through hawala channels to co-accused Nair.\nMeanwhile, the agencies have said that Babu was involved in the conversion of bribe money into legitimate funds."}

State of Maharashtra).\nJustice Rohit B Deo made the observation while hearing a bail application filed by Assistant Conservator of Forest Vinod Shivkumar, who was accused for abetting the suicide of a subordinate female forest officer from his department. \nJustice Deo observed that despite the existence of a prima facie case, bail can be granted, more particularly if the offence is not punishable with death or life imprisonment. \nIn the present case, the Court noted, Shivkumar was booked for the commission of an offence which was not punishable with death or life sentence. \n\"Bail cannot be refused either as a pre-trial punishment or to cater to or douse the collective anger and outrage of the society,\" Justice Deo remarked. \nJustice Deo indicated to the prosecution that if there was no material on record to suggest that Shivkumar, who is member of the Indian Forest Service, will flee from the course of justice or will subvert the trial or influence the witnesses, there is no purpose in continuing his incarceration. \nNoting that the prosecution was not able to place before the Court any material to show any attempt of influencing witnesses, Justice Deo granted bail to Shivkumar upon furnishing of personal bond of Rs. 1 lakh with two solvent sureties of like amount. \nThe Court also directed Shivkumar to remain present at every date of hearing and attend the local police station every alternate Saturday. \nThe factual matrix as per the prosecution was based on three suicide notes from the deceased officer - one addressed to the then Additional Chief Conservator of Forest, Amravati and two others to her mother and her husband individually. \nBased on the complaint filed by the husband, an FIR was lodged against Shivkumar, who was then the immediate supervisor of the deceased.\nAdvocate Firdos Mirza, appearing for Shivkumar, argued two grounds for grant of bail:\nThat even if the contents of the letter are taken at face value, even a prima facie inference of abetment to suicide cannot be drawn.\nThat even if the contents of the three letters translate into evidence, the allegations are belied by the other material collected during investigation.\nPerusing the letters submitted by the prosecution, the Court noted that the deceased had blamed the applicant of continuous, systematic, sustained and deliberate persecution. She alleged that she was insulted and humiliated in the presence of colleagues and villagers, that she was threatened of departmental action and involvement in criminal prosecution, and that she was summoned at odd hours and addressed in inappropriate language.\nThe Court thus opined that the \"cumulative effect of the allegations is that a reasonable inference can be drawn, that a situation was deliberately created as would compel a lady officer of even a normal sensitivity to contemplate the extreme step.\"\nHowever, it clarified that these prima facie observations were being made only to consider the bail application and it was for the trial court to consider if the conduct of the accused pushed the deceased to commit suicide. \nAssistant Public Prosecutor KR Deshpande submitted to the Court that Shivkumar had made an attempt to leave Nagpur soon after the subordinate committed suicide. \nThe Court, however, was not convinced that such conduct showed in any way that the applicant was a flight risk.\nThe Court observed that \"diverse responses of persons accused of a crime cannot be analyzed by any mathematical formula. Different persons react differently to an eminent implication in an offence\".\nJustice Deo held that a case for bail was made out on the following grounds, irrespective of the fact that the three letters did make out a prima facie case of abetment:\nthat the applicant is suspended and would not be in a position to influence witnesses\nthat the applicant is not at flight risk, and \nthat bail cannot be denied as a pre-trial punishment."}

The contractual appointee has no right to the post or to continue on the post unless the authorities decide to extend the term or to reappoint him,” the High Court said. \nThe facts as revealed from the petition was that two posts of lady Assistant Zila Sainik Welfare officer were created, one each for Jammu and Srinagar in the Sainik Welfare Department vide Government Order No. 03-04-2007. \nThe petitioner was appointed on April 23, 2013 as Lady Assistant against the available vacancy in Zila Sainik Welfare Office Jammu on contractual basis for a period of three years \nThe contract was liable to be terminated even earlier if she became medically unfit and unable to perform her duties, if her work and conduct was found unsatisfactory and if there was deterioration in his/her personal discipline.\nOn February 6, 2019, the respondent advertised the above post for fresh contractual appointment for a period of three years.\nThe same was challenged by the petitioner who claimed that she should be allowed to function at least till she completes 12 years of service or attains the age of 60. \nThe petition was, however, dismissed by the CAT on the ground that the appointment of the petitioner was only for a period of three years on contract basis and since the same or even the extended period has expired by efflux of time she has no right to continue on the post. \nThe submission of the counsel for the petitioner before the High Court was that though the service conditions of the petitioner provided that her appointment is on contractual basis for three years but the same could be extended and that the petitioner could serve for a maximum 12 years or till she attains the age of superannuation of 60 years.\nThe Court, however disagreed, stating that the service conditions do not provide that the services of a contractual employee in all cases is liable to be extended or that it is mandatory to extend the service for a period of 12 years or till the candidate attains the age of 60 years\"We find no error or illegality in the order of the Tribunal inasmuch as the conditions of the service relied upon by the petitioner are not mandatory in nature, more particularly when the appointment of the petitioner was contractual,\" the Court said.\nThe Court also highlighted the fact that two posts of Lady Assistant Zila Sainik Welfare Officer were created with the sole object to give benefit to the widow of armed forces personnel, wife of ex-servicemen or wife of a serving armed forces personnel. \nThe service conditions also provide that preference shall be given to ex-service women, widow of armed forces personnel, wife of ex-servicemen and wife of a serving armed forces personnel, the Court further noted. \n“Since the creation of post is in social interest to mitigate the hardship of the widow of armed forces personnel/wife of ex-servicemen/wife of a serving armed forces personnel, it is necessary that opportunity to maximum number of ladies belonging to the said category is given so that most of such ladies get the advantage and it may not remain confined to one person,\" it was observed.

Their whips get thicker, sticks more brutal to deepen bleeding wounds day-by-day, their apathy to listen the cry stronger and their sleep against call for justice turning into a deep slumber, so long as the saviours of justice, i.e. the lawyers and the Judges, do not come for rescue of the victims of injustice,\" the Court said in its January 24 order.\nThe Court noted that in industrial establishments, trade unions may justify the need for strikes by industrial laborers to fulfill their demands from employers. However, such strikes cannot be justified when it comes to court work, the bench said. \n\"Neither State Bar Council nor a Bar Association can be treated alike a Trade Union bargaining for their demands. They are well-equipped with all legal means to find out solutions to any problem. Lawyers' strike waste not only judicial time but also cause immense loss and harm to all the social values and leads to rising pendency of cases, adversely affecting the system of justice delivery, bringing more and more hardships to the litigant(s) for whom the courts are meant,\" the Court explained. \nThe Court pointed out that there is a \"human element\" to each case before a judge or a lawyer. \n\"Many of the litigants belong to the downtrodden and weaker sections of society who are defenceless, poor and ignorant. Their silent cry for a civilised human solution to their grievances and problems, and for a level playing field is a call for justice, to be felt and heard by all the components of justice delivery system,\" the Court added. \nThe bench further pointed out that if courts are shut for too long, it would drive people to seek alternative and potentially illegal avenues for dispute resolution.\n\"The resultant effect on the society as well as individuals and the nation as a whole would be unassessable. In that eventuality, we would certainly shatter the faith reposed by us in ourselves while giving us the Constitution and its soul and that would be the most unfortunate day for all of us,” the Court said.\nThe plea before the Court was registered as a public interest litigation (PIL) on Court's orders since the issue affected a large number of people.\nThe plea urged the Court to direct the competent authorities to promptly address individuals responsible for calling the strike at the Tehsil Bar Association, Ballia. \nThe Court noted that the strike in Ballia had begun on January 31, 2023, and had continued in defiance of several judgments by the Supreme Court. \nHowever, on January 19, the Court was informed that the strike had concluded and regular work had resumed. \nNevertheless, the Court kept the matter pending and asked the President/ Chairman of the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh to provide details of the action taken in the wake of the strike called by the Tehsil Bar Association.\nThe Court further took critical note of evidence indicating that strikes were called for several reasons unrelated to the legal profession such as the death of family members of lawyers. \n“The situation went to the extent that on 26.12.2023, the Bar Association passed a Resolution that the lawyers were very sad due to death of Ex-Chairman of Samajwadi Party and present District President of Samajwadi Party and abstained from work due to this reason,” the Court pointed out. \nIt went on to observe that lawyers already had a mechanism to ventilate legitimate grievances without resorting to strikes. In this regard, the High Court referred to the Grievance Redressal Committee established by the Allahabad High Court on June 6, 2023 consisting of the District Judge, Additional District Judge-I, CJM, DGC (Civil and Criminal) and the President of the Bar Association of the concerned district.\nThe Court went on to note that advocates are expected to uphold the dignity of the judicial system rather than indulging in activities that could shake the confidence of clients. \n\"Various rules ... cast an obligation on an advocate to uphold the dignity of the entire judicial system and not to indulge in any such activity by which the confidence reposed in him by his client is shaken,\" the order further stated. \nThe Court went on to direct the Uttar Pradesh Bar Council to submit the guidelines it may have formulated pertaining to the observance of condolences and other situations which would lead to lawyers abstaining from work in any district or Tehsil within the State of Uttar Pradesh.\nThe matter will be heard next on February 5.\nAdvocate Sunil Kumar Yadav appeared for the petitioner.\nCentral Standing Counsel Ashok Kumar Tiwari appeared for the respondent-authorities."}

In the event of any delayed payment, an annual interest rate of 6% would be levied from the date of the judgment until the actual payment date, the Court added.\nThe Court was hearing an appeal filed by the husband who challenged the dismissal of his divorce petition by a family court on November 7, 2019.\nThe couple got married in 2002. Initially, the husband secured an uncontested divorce decree in 2016. However, the wife submitted an application to recall the divorce decree, which was allowed. \nFollowing this, the divorce petition was reinstated and both parties presented their arguments before the family court.\nThe counsel for the husband argued that the wife had falsely accused him in criminal cases which ultimately ended in his acquittal. He further asserted that these unfounded claims along with other legal conflicts caused emotional distress and amounted to cruelty. \nFurther, he contended that the couple had been living apart since 2014 and that the bitterness from these legal battles has made reconciliation impossible.\nTaking into consideration the facts of the present case, the Court noted that while the husband had not explicitly proven cruelty in their day-to-day life, the wife's actions including filing false criminal cases and continuous legal disputes, constituted cruelty.\n“It is clear that though the appellant could not clearly establish the cruelty on the part of the respondent till filing a divorce petition in their day-to-day life, this fact is also undisputed that the respondent had lodged one case under Sections-498A, 420 506 and 507 IPC in 2014, before the filing of the divorce petition by the appellant,\" the Court's order stated.\nThe Court further relied on Supreme Court judgment in Naveen Kohli v Neelu Kohli, (2006) wherein it was held that filing false complaints against a spouse constituted an act of cruelty.\n“In the present case, both the parties have levelled allegation against each other for not maintaining the sanctity of marriage and their involvement in relationship outside of marriage and they have been living separately for more than ten years and number of complaints including the criminal complaints have been filed by the respondent against the appellant and every effort has been made to harass and torture him.

In the wide spectrum of powers, if the Election Commission exercises them unfairly or illegally as much as he refuses to exercise power when such exercise becomes a duty it has a telling and chilling effect on the fortunes of the political parties.\"\nIt was emphasised that the ECI has to be independent and act as per the Constitutional framework. \n\"Riding on the horse of independence, it cannot act in an unfair manner either. Independence must be related, finally, to the question of ‘what is right and what is wrong. A person, who is weak kneed before the powers that be, cannot be appointed as an Election Commissioner. A person, who is in a state of obligation or feels indebted to the one who appointed him, fails the nation and can have no place in the conduct of elections, forming the very foundation of the democracy. An independent person cannot be biased.\"\nIt also pointed out that several decades had passed, and political parties had not introduced a separate law to govern appointments to the ECI.\n\"Article 324 has a unique background. Several decades have passed by. Political parties of varying hues have not introduced a law. A law cannot be perpetuation of what is existing, of the executive having the absolute say in appointments. There is a lacuna as the petitioners have pointed out.

The reading sought to be put to Article 217(2) of the Constitution would amount to saying that the Supreme Court is not one of the Courts from which lawyers can be appointed to the High Court...There is nothing in the Constitution which provides the prohibition for lawyers practicing in the Supreme Court to be appointed as a Judge of the High Court.\"\nFurther, every lawyer is enrolled with the Bar Council of a particular state, the order points out. \nThe petitioner, Advocate Ashok Pandey, argued that as per his interpretation of Article 217 of the Constitution, a person who may have been enrolled with a State Bar Council and subsequently shifted practice to the Supreme Court, is not eligible to be appointed as a High Court judge. \nRecent examples of top court lawyers being recommended for judgeship at the Allahabad High Court were cited, as also letters by the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association calling for such appointments. \nPertinently, it was argued that the apex court needs to take cognisance of the fact that lawyers practicing before it may be better than those practicing in the High Court. \nThe Court at the outset stated that the petitioner being an advocate ought to have been well-versed with the law, and known better than to waste its time. \n\"As to what the President of the Bar may say would be his views and this Court has not given any imprimatur to any aspect for the same other than the larger principle that in suitable cases Advocate practicing in this Court can be considered for appointment to the High Court. It is not as if mere filing of the petition by the petitioner would entitle him for consideration before a Constitution bench of this Court.\" \nAccordingly, the plea was dismissed and the costs imposed were directed to be deposited with the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee within four weeks."}

Jai Singh).\nThe Bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh held the same while dismissing the wife’s appeal against the judgment of a family court which had granted a divorce decree to the husband and dissolved the marriage. The Court held,\n\"The mere fact that she made serious allegations of criminal conduct against the respondent and his parents – which she could not establish before the Court, was sufficient to constitute acts of cruelty against the respondent.\"\nAccording to records, the couple had entered into a marriage in December 2007 and out of the wedlock, a child was born in November 2011. However, disputes soon arose and the woman registered a complaint with the police under Sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code in 2013. \nThe husband as well as his parents were subsequently taken into custody. While his parents were released after a day, he was kept in custody for three days. Both the husband and his parents were acquitted in August 2015 and an appeal against the acquittal was also dismissed in January the next year.\nAfter the family court granted the husband a divorce decree on the ground of cruelty, the wife approached the High Court in appeal.\nBefore the High Court, counsel for the appellant wife had argued that she did not oppose the bail pleas of her husband and her in-laws. It was also submitted that she had filed a petition to seek restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9 of the HMA.\nHowever, the Court held that the fact that the wife did not contest the bail applications did not justify her irresponsible conduct.\n“How can the respondent be expected to allow the appellant into his life in these circumstances? The faith and trust – which is the foundation of a matrimonial bond stood completely demolished by the aforesaid conduct of the appellant. For a man to see his parents to be taken into custody and being incarcerated even for a single day would have caused immense and untold pain and agony to him...Did she not know that their conviction would have led to their being sentenced to imprisonment? Therefore, her conduct of not opposing the bail application is neither here, nor there.\"\nWith these observations, the Court upheld the order of the family court and dismissed the wife's appeal.\nThe Court, however, issued notice to the husband on the aspect of grant of permanent alimony of the wife and maintenance of their minor child. The case has been posted for hearing on this aspect on December 10.\nAdvocate Inderpal Khokhar appeared for the appellant wife."}

Union of India).\nPertinently, the Bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and CT Ravikumar said that citizens do not have any right to receive foreign contribution and permitting the same is a matter of State policy.\n\"It is open to the State to have a regime which may completely prohibit receipt of foreign donation, as no right inheres in the citizen to receive foreign contribution (donation),\" the Court held.\nThe Court observed that there is \"no dearth of donors\" in India and asked charitable associations to focus on donors within the country, to obviate influence of foreign country owing to foreign contribution.\nPermitting inflow of foreign contribution, which is a donation, is a matter of policy of the State backed by law, the Court underscored.\n\"Indisputably, no absolute right inheres in any one, much less to receive foreign contribution outside the framework delineated by the Parliament and implemented by the executive,\" the judgment said.\nThe Court held that foreign donations can influence policies of the country and lead to imposition of political ideology and hence they should be reduced.\n\"Foreign aid can create presence of a foreign contributor and influence the policies of the country. It may tend to influence or impose political ideology. Such being the expanse of the effect of foreign contribution coupled with the tenet of constitutional morality of the nation, the presence/inflow of foreign contribution in the country ought to be at 107 the minimum level, if not completely eschewed,\" the Supreme Court stated. \nThe Court, however, held that Aadhaar numbers may not be given for FCRA clearance and said that applicants should be allowed to produce passports instead.\nThe judgment was delivered on a batch of petitions challenging provisions of the FCRA Amendment Act prohibiting transfer of foreign funds (Section 7); requiring Aadhaar as identification for prior approval, registration etc (Section 12A) and mandating opening of an FCRA primary account exclusively in a branch of State Bank of India in New Delhi notified by the Centre (Section 17).\nAs per amended Section 7, a person who is registered and granted a certificate or has obtained prior permission under the Act to receive foreign contribution will henceforth be required to utilise the amount “itself” and not through any other person.\nThe top court held that \"transfer within the meaning of Section 7, therefore, would be a case of per se (simplicitor) transfer by the recipient of foreign contribution to third party without requiring to engage in the definite activities of cultural, economic, educational or social programme of the recipient of foreign contribution, for which the recipient had obtained a certificate of registration from the Central Government.\"\n\"On this interpretation, it must follow that the argument regarding amended Section 7, being ultra vires, must fail,\" the judgment said.\nThe Court made a distinction between foreign contribution and foreign investment. \n\"Foreign contribution is qualitatively different from foreign investment. Receiving foreign donation cannot be an absolute or even a vested right. By its very expression, it is a reflection on the constitutional morality of the nation as a whole being incapable of looking after its own needs and problems,\" the judgment states. \nThe Bench opined that the aspirations of any country cannot be fulfilled on the hope of foreign donation, but by firm and resolute approach of its own citizens to achieve the goal by sheer dint of their hard work and industry.\n\"Indeed, charitable activity is a business. Receiving contribution within India to do charitable activity can be and is being regulated differently. It is not possible to have a similar approach relating to foreign contribution from foreign source. In short, no one can be heard to claim a vested right to accept foreign donation, much less an absolute right,\" the Supreme Court held. \nUpholding the validity of Sections 12A and 17, the top court held that \"Parliament must be credited with for having taken recourse to corrective dispensation for eradicating the mischief, which any sovereign country can ill-afford.\" \nThe top court, however read down Section 12A and construed it as permitting the key functionaries/office bearers of the applicant (associations/NGOs) who are Indian nationals, to produce Indian Passport for the purpose of their identification. \n\"That shall be regarded as substantial compliance of the mandate in Section 12A concerning identification,\" the judgment reads. \nSenior Advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocate Gautam Jha represented the petitioners.

He, however, didn't select her but made advances to her, though she did not reciprocate. Later, the victim then got a receptionist's job at another office.\nOn the day of the incident, the accused barged into the office of the victim's boss. There, she asked her to make entry in the visitor's book, and insulted her by referring to her caste.\n“Tuzi layaki kay ahe, tu chambhar kuthali, tula me jawal karnyacha praytna kela tar tula maj ala.\" (What is your worth, you Chambhar. I tried to get close to you and that has made you arrogant)\nThe accused through his counsel Aniket Nikam argued that the First Information Report (FIR) did not mention his client's caste.\nIt was contended it is incumbent on the prosecution to demonstrate that the appellant does not belong to SC or ST community. In the absence of such positive assertion in the FIR, the offences punishable under Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) cannot be said to have been prima facie made out.\nThe Court, however, rejected this argument. \n\"Undoubtedly, a person who is a member of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe cannot be prosecuted for commission of atrocities on the other members of SC ST. The prosecution is enjoined to establish that the perpetrator of the alleged offence under Section 3 of the SC and ST Act is not a member of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe. However, this burden on the prosecution does not necessarily support a proposition that the fact that the accused does not belong to SC/ST must be mentioned in the FIR and failure to do so entails the consequence of drawing an inference that no prima facie offence is made out, or for that matter, quashing the prosecution. At multiple stages in the course of prosecution for the offence punishable under Section 3 of the SC/ ST Act, the said question can be agitated, addressed and determined,\" the Court held.\nNikam's next argument was that mere reference to the caste of the prosecutrix in the allegations attributed to the accused would not be sufficient to bring the conduct of the accused within the dragnet of Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC and ST Act.\nIn the orders, the judge further noted from the FIR, that the victim and three other witnesses in the case have consistently stated that the Rathod humiliated her by uttering words with reference to her caste.\nThe Court rejected the same too holding that laying down such a broad proposition would be hazardous. \n\"In this view of the matter, it would be difficult, at this stage, to draw an inference that the offences punishable under Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(s) of the SC and ST Act are not prima facie made out. The appeal stands dismissed,\" the Court ruled. \nAdvocate Aniket Nikam appeared for the accused, while additional public prosecutor A R Patil represented the state.

Afterall, we are dealing with rights of the citizens of India,\" the bench held.\nIn view of this, the bench quashed one such order passed under Section 144(2) of the CrPC and allowed the opposition party member before the Court to conduct a political rally slated to be held on August 26.\n\"The duty of the Administration is to provide a level playing field to all political dispensations to hold rallies and processions.

The Court had emphasised at the time that there should be equal space for all political ideologies in West Bengal.\nIn this case, the opposition party initially wanted to hold a rally on August 19. However, permission was denied by the local police authorities citing a 'law and order' situation in the area and the promulgation of an order under Section 144(2), CrPC.\nThe rally was then rescheduled for August 26 but stalled again citing the order under Section 144 (2) of the CrPC.\nThe party's mandal president Rajib Samanta (petitioner), therefore, approached the High Court for relief, contending that the State authorities were trying to curb the exercise of democratic rights. \nThe petitioner pointed out that there had been violence in many places during the recent panchayat elections. However, none of these places were placed under a Section 144, CrPC order, the Court was told. \nAs such, the petitioner asserted that the Section 144 order under challenge was malicious and only meant to prevent the opposition party from holding its rally. \nThe bench, in turn, allowed the petition after noting that a State report filed in the Court indicated that the situation in Khejuri, Purbi Medinipur, where the rally was sought to be held, appeared to be normal. \n\"As it appears from the further report filed by the State, there is admittedly some normalcy in the situation. It also does not appear that from the date on which earlier meeting was cancelled till this day there had been any untoward incident in the locality.

This would mean that they are expected to do all that is within their control to do and submit with the Scrutiny Committee a valid application for their consideration,” the bench said.\nThe Court was dealing with a case where the litigant (appellant) had successfully contested in the Jambulan village Gram Panchayat elections in 2020 from a seat reserved for Other Backward Castes (OBC). \nHe had a caste certificate indicating that he belonged to the Lonari caste (an OBC caste) which was issued in 2013. \nHowever, the rules require a validity certificate to also be submitted to support the genuineness of the caste certificate. This validity certificate is issued after an examination by a scrutiny committee. \nThe appellant before the Court had applied for this caste validity certificate on the day when he filed for his nomination to the panchayat post in 2020. \nHe was elected to the post in 2021. \nHowever, he did not submit the caste validity certificate on time, leading to his retrospective disqualification from the panchayat post. \nAfter he failed to secure any relief from the High Court, the appellant moved the Supreme Court. \nNotably, the High Court had observed that the \"mere filing of the application\" for a caste validity certificate was not enough and that a candidate seeking to occupy an elected post reserved for a caste has to ensure that the application is \"properly filed and followed through.\"\nThe High Court had also found that the appellant's first application for a caste validity certificate was \"rejected\" in 2021 because it was defective. It declined to accept an argument that the 2021 order was not a rejection or that the application was only \"re-filed\" later.\nThe Supreme Court opined that the appellant's caste validity certificate should have been submitted by January 20, 2022, which was not done. \nThe Court added that the appellant could not also not avail of the time relaxations to submit the validity certificate under the Maharashtra Temporary Extension of Period for Submitting Validity Certificate (for certain elections to Village Panchayats, Zilla Parishads, and Panchayat Samitis) Act, 2023. \nThis was because the panchayat member had not communicated the election results to the Scrutiny Committee within the stipulated time of two weeks after the election results. \nTo allow the appellant to avail the benefit of the Temporary Extension Act of 2023 would be like letting him take advantage of his own wrong, the Supreme Court added.\n\"We hold that the Appellant No.1 stood automatically disqualified as a Member since he failed to produce the Validity Certificate within 12 months from the date of his election. The protective umbrella of Section 3 of the Temporary Extension Act, 2023 will not be available to Appellant No.1 since he is hit by Section 3(2)(b), for the reason that there was no valid application pending on the date of the commencement of the said Act,\" the Court concluded. \nHence, the Supreme Court confirmed the High Court order and dismissed the appeal. \nSenior Advocate Gaurav Agrawal appeared for the appellants.

He made the victim a party to the proceeding. \nThe High Court observed that there was lack of clarity among lawyers, investigating agencies and court registries about the presence of the victim in appeals arising from convictions or in applications seeking suspension of sentences. \nThis confusion in turn add to the hardship or agony of the victim and its parents or guardians. \n“The child/victim of the crime is required to attend the High Court because in every appeal and the application seeking suspension of sentence the notice is being issued to the child/ victim under the misnomer that the victim’s presence in the appeal and the application seeking suspension of sentence is mandatory. The experience shows that almost in all cases the child along with parents is brought to the Court,\" the single-judge said. \nJustice Pansare explained that the purpose of issuing notice to the victim was to apprise the victim and the family about the stage of proceedings to enable them to participate, if they so desire. \n\"In the application filed for suspension of sentence, the child/victim will have no role to play because the judgment along with entire evidence is before the appellate Court. The presence of the Prosecutor is sufficient to decide the application. In such circumstances, the appraisal of the status of the proceedings to the child/victim through child’s family or guardian etc. should serve the purpose and their presence should be left to their wisdom,\" the court concluded. \nWith these observations, the Court directed that the victim and parents should not be added as parties to the application seeking suspension of sentences, but should be added only in application seeking interim bail. \nAdvocate NS Giripunje appeared for the appellant. \nAdditional public prosecutor Amit Chutke appeared for the State."}

Sexual activities with young girls of immature age have a traumatic effect on them, which persists throughout their life and often destruct whole personality of the victim,\" the Court said.\nPertinently, the Court while referring to the Supreme Court verdict in Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat noted that the top court has held that rarely a girl or woman in India makes a false allegation of sexual assault.\n\"A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. Such girl would be conscious of the danger of being ostracized by the society or being looked down by the society including her relatives etc,\" the Court observed said, rejecting the argument that the girls falsely implicated their father.\nAs per the prosecution case, the man's wife had died by suicide on November 14, 2007 due to the frequent quarrels between her and the appellant. Soon after her death, the accused started sexually assaulting his elder daughter, who was a minor at that time. \nThe sexual abuse became a routine for the girl and since the appellant was her father, she didn't complain about him to anyone.\nWhen the man started abusing his younger daughter too, the elder daughter informed the same to their maternal aunt. The accused, however, claimed that the aunt was forcing him to marry her and on his refusal, she had tutored the girls to depose against him.\nHowever, the girls mustered courage on July 30, 2013 and lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against him under charges of rape (376) under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.\nThe bench noted that the testimony of the two victims inspired confidence and was corroborated by other relevant evidence.\n\"It hardly needs to be mentioned that rape is a ghastly act which leaves the victim shattered for the life as it causes not only physical but emotional and psychological trauma to the victim. Sexual activities with young girls of immature age have a traumatic effect on them, which persists throughout their life and often destruct whole personality of the victim,\" the Court observed in the judgment pronounced on July 25.\nStressing on the importance of properly appreciating the testimony of a rape victim, the bench reiterated that the victim of a sexual assault is not an accomplice, but a victim of lust of another person.\n\"Her evidence stands at a higher pedestal than that of an injured witness. Evidence of victim of rape case is required to receive same weight as is attached to evidence of an injured witness. If totality of circumstances emerging on record discloses that the victim of such crime does not have any motive to falsely implicate the accused, then, it is not required to seek corroboration to her evidence and the Court generally needs to accept her evidence,\" the bench said.\nWhile dealing with cases of sexual assault on females of tender ages, the Court is expected to shoulder great responsibility and is required to deal with such cases sensibly, the Court opined.\n\"Broader probabilities of the prosecution case are required to be examined in such crimes and the Court is not expected to get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in evidence of prosecution which does not go to the core of the prosecution case,\" the bench added, while upholding the man's conviction and life sentence.\nAdvocates Vikram Deo Singh, Jitendra Prasad Singh and Shankar Kumar appeared for the appellant.\nAdditional Public Prosecutor Abhimanyu Sharma represented the State."}

Union of India. \n\"It is plain and simple, discrimination based on age. The criterion (of minimum 50 years of age) is virtually “picked out from a hat” and wholly arbitrary,\" Justice Bhat said. \nThe Court further held that Section 184(7) relating to recommendation of two names for each post by the Search-cum-Selection Committee (SCSC) and further, requiring the decision to be taken by the Government preferably within three months is violative of the Constitution.\nHowever, the Court upheld the proviso to Section 184(11), but the appointments made to the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) pursuant to the interim orders passed by the top court shall be governed by the relevant statute and the rules framed under the same that existed prior to May 26, 2017.\nJustice Hemant Gupta, the third judge on the Bench, delivered a partly dissenting judgment. He struck down Sections 184(11) 184(7) but upheld the first, second and third proviso to Section 184(1). The proviso to Section 184(11) was also upheld by him. \nThe petitioner association had approached the Supreme Court after the Central government promulgated the ordinance in April 2021 amending nine central legislations and abolishing four tribunals. \nThe ordinance was introduced after the 2020 judgment of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar Association v. Union of India in which the top court had ordered some modifications to the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2020 (2020 Rules). \nThe Court in that judgment had ordered that the 2020 Rules shall apply prospectively from February 12, 2020 and issued a slew of directions to govern tribunals and the appointments and service conditions of tribunal members.\nAs per the same, lawyers with legal practice of 10 years will be eligible for appointment as judicial members of tribunals.\nAfter the 2020 judgment of the Supreme Court in Madras Bar Association, the ordinance was promulgated in April 2021.\nWith respect to Finance Act, 2017, Section 12 of the ordinance substituted Section 184, Section 13 of the ordinance inserted Section 186(2) and the Eighth Schedule was amended so as to omit four tribunals and to substitute the item relating to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.\nIn its plea before the Supreme Court, the Association submitted that the challenged provisions are in \"contravention of the principles of separation of powers, independence of the judiciary (both being part of the basic structure of our Constitution), and are against efficient and effective administration of justice\".\nThe plea stated that Section 184 of the Finance Act, 2017 contravenes the previous decision of the Supreme Court in Union of India v R. Gandhi [(2010) 11 SCC 1], Madras Bar Association v Union of India, [(2014) 10 SCC 1], Rojer Mathew v South Indian Bank Ltd, [(2020) 6 SCC 1] and Madras Bar Association v Union of India (2020).\nThe plea further said that first proviso to Section 184(1) provides for a minimum age limit of 50 years and that it is \"arbitrary, unconstitutional and against the directions of Supreme Court in R Gandhi, Rojer Mathew and, in particular, Madras Bar Association case.\n\"Section 184(1), second proviso states that all allowances and benefits shall be to the extent as are admissible to a Central Government officer holding the post carrying the same pay. It is submitted that this provision is contrary to the decision of this Hon’ble Court in Madras Bar Assn. (2020) [Para 53(xiv)], and would also have the effect of denying the benefits under the decision to future members,\" the plea said.\nOne of the moot point of the hearing was whether the retrospective effect given to Section 184(11) of Finance Act would override the judgments of the Supreme Court.\nThe Central government had maintained that the Parliament is empowered to enact laws overturning Supreme Court judgments.\nThis submission was made by Attorney General KK Venugopal after Justice Hemant Gupta had asked Central government \"if you are enacting legislation then are you not nullifying the judgment of this court?\"\n\"I am sorry to say but Your Lordships can pass any number of orders but the parliament can say it is not in interest of the country and enact a law,\" Venugopal had responded. \nThe Court in its judgment on Wednesday held that the permissibility of legislative override in this country should be in accordance with the principles laid down by the Supreme Court which are as follows:\na) The effect of the judgments of the Court can benullified by a legislative act removing the basis of the judgment. Such law can be retrospective. Retrospective amendment should be reasonable and not arbitrary and must not be violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution;\nb) The defect pointed out should have been cured such that the basis of the judgment pointing out the defect is removed;\nc) Nullification of mandamus by an enactment would be impermissible legislative exercise;\nd) Transgression of constitutional limitations and intrusion into the judicial power by the legislature is violative of the principle of separation of powers, the rule of law and of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\nJustice Bhat in his concurring opinion stated that it is too late now to contend that independence of judiciary and separation of powers are vague concepts based on which Parliamentary reenactment cannot be invalidated.\nConstitution, he observed, does not and cannot be read so as to provide two kinds of justice - one through courts, and one through other bodies.\n\"The quality and efficacy of these justice delivery mechanisms have to be the same, i.e., the same as that provided by courts, as increasingly, tribunals adjudicate disputes not only between state agencies and citizens, but also between citizens and citizens as well as citizens and powerful corporate entities,\" he said."}
{"id": "id_734", "reference_summary": "The Delhi High Court today ordered for the dispute between L&L Partners Senior Partner Mohit Saraf and Founder Rajiv Luthra to be decided by mediation.\nThe mediation will be conducted by Senior Advocate Sriram Panchu.\nThe matter was heard by a Bench of Justice V Kameswara Rao. \nAfter hearing the parties at length today, Justice Rao said,\n\"We'll put it for mediation..if it doesn't work out, come back. I'll decide the petition.\"\nJustice V Kameswara Rao\nAs per the Court's order, the mediation will take place virtually either tomorrow and day after, as per Panchu's convenience. \nThe Court also clarified that the fee payable to Panchu shall be shared equally by Luthra and Saraf. \nAt the outset of today's hearing, Senior Advocate Arvind Nigam, appearing for Mohit Saraf, said that this was not a matter that should have come to court.\nNigam then took the Court through the partnership deed of the firm and highlighted the clauses on termination and dissolution of partnership, induction of new partners, dues payable to a partner who exists etc. \nWhile dealing with the clause on induction of new partners to the firm, Nigam stated,\n\"If the two [Saraf and Luthra] don't agree to induction of a partner, Luthra may give away part of his own profit to the new partner. However, this new partner will have no rights.\"\nWhen the Court reconvened after the lunch break, Nigam submitted that Luthra had given notice of his withdrawal from the firm on January 6 this year. \nThis notice period was extended on April 4, April 30 and then again on August 30. It was last extended till October 31, he said. \nNigam said that finally, on October 12, Luthra's withdrawal from the firm was accepted by Saraf. \nHe went on to argue,\nSpeaking of Luthra's decision to remove Saraf from the partnership, Nigam argued,\n\"There is no consent on dissolution of firm...not only has he terminated (me), he has removed my name and removed my access to my email, papers. Entire IT infrastructure is blocked...\n...I accepted his resignation but I did not block his access. A partner remains a partner till accounts are settled. He has barred me from the assets of the firm, which he cannot do. He has published it in the newspaper.\"\nStating that Saraf has approached the High Court to challenge this decision, Nigam said,\n\"Irreparable damage would be caused to all the lawyers in the firm and the clients. The balance of convenience is in my favour.\"\nHe thus sought that Saraf's access to the firm and its infrastructure be restored, and that the bouncers deployed at the office be removed.\nRevealing that Luthra's decision was brought to Saraf's attention through a client, Nigam concluded,\n\"I am sorry that this matter has come to court. It should have been mediated and settled..I am willing to go to a time-bound mediation...subject to status quo ante.\"\nSenior Advoate Dayan Krishnan also appeared with Senior Advocate Nigam. \nSenior Advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul then made submissions on behalf of Luthra. He was later joined by Senior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi. \nAccusing Saraf of leaking confidential information of the firm and sharing private WhatsApp communication with third parties, he said,\n\"The way out is that you [Saraf] go out. We will give what he is entitled to.\"\nSaraf's conduct was unbecoming of a lawyer, Kaul said. \nTaking the Court through the clauses of the partnership deed, Kaul said,\n\"The deed is replete with clauses which give power to Mr Luthra and the person who has to leave is Mr Saraf...In the event of disagreement, the decision of Luthra was final...The only person who has the right to induct new partners in case of disagreement is Luthra and not Saraf.\"\nKaul thus argued that in the matters of termination, the ultimate power vested with Luthra and not Saraf. \n\"It is not a partnership at will and only Luthra has the right to terminate or withdraw\", he said. \nKaul submitted that given the circumstances, Luthra was left with no option but to terminate the partnership of Saraf. Referring to Luthra, he said,\n\"Here is a man who is hurt..He has always taken people along with him. He has mentored three generations of lawyers.\"\nAsserting that Saraf's case was based on a misreading of several Whatsapp exchanges, Kaul clarified that as per the partnership deed, the only way that Luthra could exit was either through retirement or withdrawal.\nSenior Advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, appearing for Rajiv Luthra, raised an objection at the very outset. He said,\n\"He (Saraf) has made persons who are not party to the arbitration agreement as parties.\"\nSinghvi submitted that to say that Luthra intended to retire was a complete red herring. \nSinghvi reiterated that in all crucial matters, including termination, the power belonged to Luthra and not Saraf. \n\"We are paying Rs 15 crores without being liable to pay\", he said. \nBoth the counsel opposed passing of any orders at this stage. \nThey nonetheless agreed that the dispute be sent to mediation. \nThe two senior-most partners at L&L Partners have been embroiled in a tiff over the dilution of the firm's equity for weeks now.\nThe main contention in Saraf's plea before the Delhi High Court is that he cannot be summarily thrown out of the firm using strong-arm tactics.\nEven as Saraf rejected Luthra's proposal that all partners holding equity dilute their stake in the firm, the latter went on to induct two equity partners into the firm.\nEventually, Saraf wrote to the corporate partners stating that he had accepted Luthra's earlier offer to retire and withdraw from the firm. He also alleged that there were \"material breaches of the partnership deed\" by Luthra.\nIn response, Luthra not only denied retiring from the law firm, but also terminated Saraf's partnership on account of the latter's \"clumsy strategy\" on equity dilution.\nOn September 24, a firm-wide Zoom conference turned a bit ugly, with Luthra and Saraf both making allegations against each other. Luthra openly spoke against Saraf and his future plans with regard to the firm, while Saraf retaliated and made some nasty remarks against Luthra.\nDuring the call, equity partners from the Litigation Practice at L&L (Litigation Partnership) showed their support towards Luthra.\nWith a view to coming clean about the partnership to the lawyers at L&L, Saraf subsequently sent an email to members of the firm highlighting important clauses of the partnership deed of L&L Partners.\nRead the Order:"}

Therefore, litigation costs quantified at ₹1 lakh shall be paid by the respondent No.1 – UOI to the petitioner within four weeks,\" the Court ordered.\nThe Court was hearing a plea by BLA Industries which stated that its name was incorrectly included by the Central government in the list of 46 coal block allottees before the Supreme Court in 2014 case of ML Sharma vs Union of India. \nThe petitioner had not been allotted coal block through the Screening Committee constituted by the Ministry of Coal of Union of India. \nThe Coalgate case before the top court considered prayer regarding quashing of the allocation of coal blocks to private companies made by the Central government between 1993 to 2011. \nIn its 2014 judgment in that case, the apex court held that the exercise undertaken by the Central government of allocation of coal blocks, was neither traceable to the MMDR Act or the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act and the practice and procedure adopted by the Central government for allocation of coal blocks to the beneficiaries through the Screening Committee Route, was inconsistent with the law already enacted and the Rules framed. Consequently, it declared that the entire allocation of coal blocks as per the Screening Committee recommendations were illegal. \nPursuant to the judgment of the Court, the Central government demanded an additional levy from the petitioner as compensation towards coal extracted.\nAdvocate Abhimanyu Bhandari, appearing for the petitioner, argued that the erroneous inclusion of the name of the petitioner in the list of 46 allottees of coal blocks and the erroneous inclusion of its name at serial No. 22 and 23 in an annexure-1 filed by the Central government before this Court, resulted in cancellation /quashing of the lease that was validly granted in its favour\nAdditional Solicitor General Balbir Singh, appearing for the Central government, contended that the additional levy has been imposed in principle on the beneficiaries of illegal allocation like the petitioner.\nHe stated that the object and purpose of imposition of the additional levy was that since the process of allocation was found to be fundamentally flawed by the Supreme Court therefore, all the beneficiaries of the said flawed process including the petitioner ought to suffer the consequences and compensate the public exchequer for the loss caused.\nPertinently, he also highlighted how the petitioner along with some other allottees had attended the 11th Meeting of the Screening Committee held on 26th-27th September, 1997 and once the allocations made by the Central government on the recommendations of the Screening Committee have been held by the Supreme Court to be illegal, the petitioner cannot claim any different treatment from that extended to the other allottees. \nThe Supreme Court, however, held that the fact that the BLA Industries had participated in the meetings conducted by the Screening Committee cannot be held against it.\n\"Participation in the said meetings can also not be taken to mean that the petitioner had applied directly to the respondent No.1 (Union of India) for grant of the mining lease. In fact, the records reveal that the letter dated 21st June, 1996 issued by the respondent No. 1 stating that the petitioner’s proposal for identification of the captive mining block for supply of coal to the 24 MW captive power plant in Madhya Pradesh was considered in the meeting of the Screening Committee and was approved, never found its way to the respondent No. 2 – State Government,\" the Court said.\nThe Court further noted that the affidavit by State of Madhya Pradesh supported the claim of the petitioner.\n\"Affidavit filed by State government is in consonance with the plea taken by the petitioner that the decision to grant the mining lease in its favour was not based on any allocation letter issued directly by the Central Government and/or the Screening Committee, but was founded on an independent consideration of the petitioner’s application made by the State government and done in accordance with the provisions of the MMDR Act read with the MC Rules,\" the judgment said.\nNo parity can be drawn between the petitioner and the other allottees of the coal blocks when the petitioner followed the correct procedure of applying through proper channel for grant of a mining lease, the Supreme Court said.\nThe Court further observed that this was a case where a private party followed all the rules and the law, as applicable, before investing large sums of money to undertake business, and it was Central government that did not follow the letter of the law.\n\"To compound the petitioner’s woes, the respondent no. 1 filed an affidavit before this Court including the petitioner in the list of errant mine owners, based on its own unlawful conduct.

[Anuja Arun Redij v. State of Maharashtra]\nA Division Bench of Justices Gautam Patel and Gauri Godse said that the object of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 is to protect the wildlife, as also citizens from wild animals.\n\"It is necessary to note that it is the duty of the concerned officer of the State Government to protect wild animals and not allow them to wander outside the restricted safety zone. Similarly, as a corollary duty, it is also the obligation cast upon the concerned officers to protect the citizens from any injuries by the wild animals. Thus, it is a twin obligation of the State Government.\"\nThe Bench was hearing a widow's plea seeking monetary compensation as per a Government Resolution (GR) issued for providing financial help to citizens attacked by wild animals. She pointed out that she had made an application before the concerned authorities in February 2019 and again repeated the same a month later. \nIt was noted that the State did not produce any such GR on record. In this light, the Bench opined,\n\"In any case, 48 hours timeline is irrelevant so far as the claim made by the Petitioner is concerned. In any event this will not absolve the State from its liability to pay compensation. A human life is lost in the accident thus the reasons given by the authorities and its communication itself is illegal and unjustified.\"\nFurther, the Bench said if a wild animal causes injury to any person, it amounts to a failure of the State government to protect the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. \n\"Therefore, if any wild animal causes injury to any person, this in fact is a failure of the State Government to protect right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In the present case, it is clear from the said GR that the citizens who suffer loss due to wild animals are entitled to compensation. Thus, the said GR creates an additional obligation on the State Government to protect the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. In our view even dehors the said GR it is the obligation of the State to pay reasonable compensation, as it could not protect the right to life of the deceased. Thus, the State's approach is not acceptable and in fact is dis-heartening,\" the order stated.\nThe Court thus ordered the authorities to compensate the widow with an interest of 6 per cent. It further ordered the authorities to pay her costs of ₹50,000 for rejecting her application on account of hyper-technicalities. \nSenior Advocate Ram Apte and Advocate Ketan Dhavle appeared for the petitioner widow. \nAdditional Government Pleader Milind More represented the State."}

{"id": "id_866", "reference_summary": "The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya (Second) Bill in the absence of 97 opposition MPs who are under suspension.\nThe bills aim to replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and the Indian Evidence Act.\nThe three bills to reform criminal laws were first introduced in Lok Sabha on August 11 during the monsoon session of Parliament as Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and the Bharatiya Sakshya Bill, 2023. \nThey were subsequently referred to a department-related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs headed by Brij Lal for further examination which submitted its reports on November 10.\nPertinently, instead of amending the bills as per the committee's suggestions, the Central government on December 11 chose to withdraw the bills. In a statement, it was mentioned that the bills will be reintroduced after making changes recommended by the Parliamentary Standing Committee.\nThe following day, the government reintroduced the latest iteration of the bills. Union Home Minister Amit Shah insisted that the bills were withdrawn and reintroduced to save effort that would have gone towards passing separate amendments. \nThe Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita now comprises 358 sections. The first version of this bill had 356 sections with 175 sourced from the Indian Penal Code (IPC) with alterations, and by which 22 Sections were proposed to be repealed, and 8 new Sections introduced.\nNotably, although the offence of 'sedition', which was kept in abeyance by the Supreme Court, has not been retained, a very similar provision has been added to the proposed legislation. Section 152 punishes acts 'endangering sovereignty, unity and integrity of India.'\nOrganised crime, terrorism, and murder by a group of five or more on the basis caste, language or personal belief have been added as offences.\nThe Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha (Second) Sanhita now has 531 Sections. The first bill consisted of 533 Sections, out of which 150 were sourced from the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) after revisions, 22 Sections of the earlier CrPC were proposed to be repealed, and 9 Sections were to be newly added.\nThe proposed code has ushered in new concepts like timelines for mercy petitions, a scheme for witness protection and permitting electronic modes for recording statements and collecting evidence. For offences punishable with imprisonment of seven years or more, forensic investigation has been made mandatory. \nAnother significant provision expands the scope of summary trials, specifically in cases where the punishment does not exceed three years. This streamlining of legal processes is aimed at expediting justice and ensuring a more efficient judicial system.\nMoreover, the proposed law introduces stringent timelines for various procedural aspects. For instance, it mandates that the police must present their challan before the court within seven days of the first hearing. Furthermore, the legislation stipulates that investigation must conclude within 90 days of filing a chargesheet. Notably, judgments reserved are required to be pronounced within 30 days.\nThe Bharatiya Sakshya Bill remains unchanged and has 170 Sections. Of these, 23 Sections have been sourced from the Indian Evidence Act with amendments, 1 Section is entirely new, and 5 Sections are proposed to be removed.\nNotably, a few MPs, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey questioned the Supreme Court's reading down of Section 377 of IPC and called for its reintroduciton. However, no such amendment was notified by the Home Minister. \nAddressing the Lok Sabha when the first iteration of the bills was introduced, Amit Shah had stated that the process of drafting the three laws involved consultations with 18 states, 7 Union Territories, judges from the Supreme Court and High Courts, along with 22 law universities, 142 MPs, 270 MLAs, and numerous members of the public. This effort apparently spanned four years and encompassed a total of 158 meetings.\nBefore the passage of the bills today in absence of 97 MPs who have been suspended this session, Shah reiterated his stance from a September speech that the proposed overhaul is not punitive but focused on ensuring justice for all.\nIn response to concerns that the overhaul will transform India into a police state, the Minister argued that while some additional powers are being granted to the police, certain existing powers are also being restricted.\n\"It is to avoid becoming a police state that these laws are being passed,\" Shah maintained."}

We are amazed at the audacity of the then Hon’ble Forest Minister and Mr. Kishan Chand, DFO in giving a total go-bye to the statutory provisions. However, since the matter is pending investigation by the CBI, we do not propose to comment any further on the matter,\" the Court said.\nThe CBI was asked to complete its probe effectively, and the State directed to initiate disciplinary proceedings against errant officials.\nThe Court further stated that the illegal tree felling that had taken place in the park could not be ignored. \nAs regards the Safaris, the Court directed,\n\"The Safaris which are already existing and the one under construction at Pakhrau will not be disturbed. However, insofar as the Safari at ‘Pakhrau’ is concerned, we direct the State of Uttarakhand to relocate or establish a rescue centre in the vicinity of the ‘Tiger Safari’.\" \nThe Court also ordered the constitution of a committee to restore the damages and quantify costs of restoration. \n\"Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) shall constitute a committee of representative of NTCA, MoEF CEC officer not below rank of Joint Secretary and wildlife authority. They shall recommend measures to restore the damages and quantify costs of restoration. Identify officers who are liable and the cost shall be recovered from them. Cost to be exclusively used for restoration of damage,\" the Court further directed.\nIt also requested ex-Director General of Forests & Special Secretary Chander Prakash Goyal and IFS officers Anup Malik and Samir Sinha to give their suggestions for more effective management of tiger reserves in India.\nThe verdict came in a case regarding permissions for the planned Pakhro Tiger Safari project at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.\nThe bench had in January told the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) that its plan to have a tiger safari on the lines of a zoo within the national park cannot be allowed. \nIt called for an approach that is 'animal-centric', rather than 'tourism-centric', referring to NCTA guidelines providing for tiger safaris only in buffer and fringe areas of such reserves.\nThe case arose out of a petition filed by environment activist and advocate Gaurav Bansal, challenging the Uttarakhand government’s proposal in this regard. \nAs per the State's affidavit, Uttarakhand is home to 560 tigers with 260 at the Corbett Tiger Reserve that is spread across 1,288 square kilometres.\nThe tiger safari proposed at Pakhrau was on a land of 106 hectares, which is about 0.082 per cent of the total area at the national park, and 0.22 per cent of the buffer area of the tiger reserve.\nSenior Advocate ANS Nadkarni appeared for the State of Uttarakhand. Advocate K Parameswar served as the Amicus Curiae. \nAdditional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati appeared for the NTCA.\nThe National Green Tribunal had in November 2022 ordered that the Pakhro Tiger Safari project in Jim Corbett National Park be halted in view of the fact that around 6,000 trees were illegally cut for the project."}
{"id": "id_978", "reference_summary": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of a convict belonging to a Scheduled Tribe community, to life imprisonment, in a case of rape and murder of a minor girl [Bhagwani v State of Madhya Pradesh].\nA Bench of Justices L Nageshwar Rao, BR Gavai and BV Nagarathna noted that while the trial court and the High Court took the gravity of the crime into account, they failed to consider the mitigating circumstances including the convict's socio-economic background and probability of reformation and rehabilitation.\nThe Court, however, made it clear that the appellant-convict will not be entitled to remission for 30 years.\n\"The Appellant was aged 25 years on the date of commission of the offence and belongs to a Scheduled Tribes community, eking his livelihood by doing manual labour. No evidence has been placed by the prosecution on record to show that there is no probability of rehabilitation and reformation of the Appellant and the question of an alternative option to death sentence is foreclosed. The Appellant had no criminal antecedents before the commission of crime for which he has been convicted. There is nothing adverse that has been reported against his conduct in jail. Therefore, the death sentence requires to be commuted to life imprisonment,\" the Court held.\nThe Bench also observed that the appellant was denied a bifurcated hearing for conviction and sentence and thereby, he was refused the effective opportunity to present relevant material on the question of death penalty. \nThe appellant was accused of kidnapping and rape of a 11-year-old girl whose body was found with severe injury marks. The postmortem report concluded that the death was caused by asphyxiation and neurogenic shock due to pressing of neck and the forceful commission of rape.\nThe appellant was charged for offences under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 366A (procuration of minor girl), 364 (kidnapping in order to murder), 346 (wrongful confinement), 302 (murder), 201 (evidence tampering) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 5(g) (m) read with Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. \nHe was convicted and sentenced to death by the trial court and the same was upheld by the Madhya Pradesh High Court prompting the present appeal before the top court.\nAfter considering the rival contentions and examining the material on record, the Supreme Court held that there was no fault in convicting the appellant. \nHowever, it noted that when it came to sentencing, the trial court had denied the appellant a fair hearing by not providing him a separate hearing on sentencing. \n\"It is travesty of justice as the appellant was not given a fair opportunity to defend himself. This is a classic case indicating the disturbing tendency of trial courts adjudicating criminal cases involving rape and murder in haste. It is trite law that an accused is entitled for a fair trial which is guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India,\" the Court observed.\nThe judgment convicting him was dictated by the trial court on November 3, 2017. On the same day, the order, sentencing the appellant to death was also passed. \n\"A bifurcated hearing for convicting and sentencing is necessary to provide an effective opportunity to the accused. Adequate opportunity to produce relevant material on the question of death sentence shall be provided to the accused by the trial court,\" the apex court said.\nIn the present case, the Court noted that mitigating circumstances were not considered by the trial court while sentencing the accused to death. \nThe Court noted that the appellant belonging to a Scheduled Tribes community was aged 25 years on the date of commission of the offence and used to eke out his livelihood by doing manual labour and he had no criminal antecedents. There was also no adverse report against him about his conduct in jail.\nThe Court, therefore, proceeded to commute the death penalty to life imprisonment. \n\"However, taking into account the barbaric and savage manner in which the offences of rape and murder were committed by the Appellant on a hapless 11 year old girl, the Appellant is sentenced to life imprisonment for a period of 30 years during which he shall not be granted remission,\" the Court ruled"}

{"id": "id_991", "reference_summary": "The Karnataka High Court recently ruled that wife humiliating her husband by calling him dark-skinned amounts to cruelty.\nThe Court further noted that the wife's decision to distance herself from the company of her husband and to level false allegations against him of having illicit relationships to cover up this aspect, was cruel. \nA bench of Justice Alok Aradhe and Anant Ramanath Hegde made the observation while allowing a husband's plea for divorce. \n\"The evidence on record, from close scrutiny also leads to the conclusion that the wife used to insult the husband on the premise that he is dark. And for the same reason has moved away from the company of the husband without any cause. And to cover up this aspect, has levelled false allegations of illicit relationships against the husband. These facts certainly will constitute cruelty,\" the Court said.\nThe Court was dealing with an appeal filed by the husband contesting the decision of a family court in Bengaluru to dismiss his plea for the dissolution of his marriage under Section 13(i)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.\nThe husband had filed for divorce in 2012. In his plea, he claimed that the wife consistently demeaned him based on his skin color. \nAdditionally, it was alleged by the husband that in 2011, his wife lodged a \"false\" complaint against him and his family members, citing cruelty under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. He further claimed that his wife had left him to reside with her parents.\nThe wife refuted the allegations and asserted that her husband had engaged in an extramarital affair with another woman. She further contended that her husband had subjected her to physical abuse and that her treatment by his family was unsatisfactory.\nThe Court, however, found that there was no acceptable evidence on record to accept the wife's allegation that her husband was having an illicit relationship with another lady. The Court, therefore, concluded that these allegations were reckless, and baseless.\nThe Court proceeded to hold that the family court failed to take into account the impact of such groundless and careless accusations concerning the husband's character.\nThe Court also took into consideration the fact that the wife was pursuing multiple legal cases against the husband and his family and there was no communication between the husband and wife for several years.\n\"When the question has been put to the wife in the cross-examination, whether she is willing to join the company of the husband, the wife though has stated that she is willing to join the company, has stated that she is not willing to withdraw any of the complaints filed against the husband and his family members. This fact would clearly establish that the wife is not willing to join the company of the husband and there is a big rift between the husband and the wife,\" the Court observed.\nAs such, the Court concluded that the husband's allegations of cruelty were duly established. Therefore, it allowed the husband's plea to dissolve his marriage and granted a decree of divorce. \nAdvocate Janardhana G appeared for the husband. Advocate D Bhuvaneshwari appeared for the wife."}
